a tale of three lion
by h rider haggard
chapter i the interest on ten shill
most of you will have heard that allan quatermain who wa on of the
parti that discov king solomon mine some littl time ago and who
afterward came to live in england near hi friend sir henri curti
he went back to the wilder again as these old hunter almost
invari do on on pretext or anoth thei cannot endur
civil for veri long it nois and racket and the omnipres
of broadcloth human prove more try to their nerv than the
danger of the desert i think that thei feel lone here for it is
a fact that is too littl understood though it ha often been state
that there is no loneli like the loneli of crowd especi
to those who ar unaccustom to them what is there in the world old
quatermain would sai so desol as to stand in the street of a great
citi and listen to the footstep fall fall multitudin as the
rain and watch the white line of face as thei hurri past you know not
whenc you know not whither thei come and go their ey meet your
with a cold stare for a moment their featur ar written on your mind
and then thei ar gone for ever you will never see them again thei
will never see you again thei come up out of the unknown and present
thei onc more vanish into the unknown take their secret with them
ye that is loneli pure and undefil but to on who know and
love it the wilder is not lone becaus the spirit of natur
is ever there to keep the wander compani he find companion in the
windsth sunni stream babbl like natur children at hi feet high
abov them in the purpl sunset ar dome and minaret and palac
such as no mortal man ha built in and out of whose flame door the
angel of the sun seem to move continu and there too is the wild
game follow it feedingground in great armi with the springbuck
thrown out befor for skirmish then rank upon rank of longfac
blesbuck march and wheel like infantri and last the shine
troop of quagga and the fierceei shaggi vilderbeest to take as it
were the place of the cossack host that hang upon an armi flank
thi of cours wa written befor mr quatermain
account of the adventur in the newlydiscov countri of
zuvendi of himself sir henri curti and capt john good
had been receiv in englandeditor
oh no he would sai the wilder is not lone for my boi
rememb that the further you get from man the nearer you grow to god
and though thi is a sai that might well be disput it is on i am
sure that anybodi will easili understand who ha watch the sun rise
and set on the limitless desert plain and seen the thunder chariot
of the cloud roll in majesti across the depth of unfathom sky
well at ani rate we went back again and now for mani month i have
heard noth at all of him and to be frank i greatli doubt if anybodi
will ever hear of him again i fear that the wilder that ha for so
mani year been a mother to him will now also prove hi grave and the
grave of those who accompani him for the quest upon which he and thei
have start is a wild on inde
but while he wa in england for those three year or so between
hi return from the success discoveri of the wise king buri
treasur and the death of hi onli son i saw a great deal of old
allan quatermain i had known him year befor in africa and after
he came home whenev i had noth better to do i us to run up to
yorkshir and stai with him and in thi wai i at on time and anoth
heard mani of the incid of hi past life and most curiou some of
them were no man can pass all those year follow the rough exist
of an elephanthunt without meet with mani strang adventur
and in on wai and anoth old quatermain ha certainli seen hi share
well the stori that i am go to tell you in the follow page is
on of the later of these adventur though i forget the exact year
in which it happen at ani rate i know that it wa the onli trip upon
which he took hi son harri who is sinc dead with him and that harri
wa then about fourteen and now for the stori which i will repeat as
nearli as i can in the word in which hunter quatermain told it to me
on night in the old oakpanel vestibul of hi hous in yorkshir
we were talk about goldmin
goldmin he broke in ah ye i onc went goldmin at
pilgrim rest in the transvaal and it wa after that that we had the
busi about jimjim and the lion do you know pilgrim rest well
it is or wa on of the queerest littl place you ever saw the town
itself wa pitch in a stoni vallei with mountain all about it and
in the middl of such sceneri as on doe not often get the chanc of
see mani and mani is the time that i have thrown down my pick and
shovel in disgust clamber out of my claim and walk a coupl of
mile or so to the top of some hill then i would lie down in the grass
and look out over the gloriou stretch of countryth smile vallei
the great mountain touch with goldreal gold of the sunset and
cloth in sweep robe of bush and stare into the depth of the
perfect sky abov ye and thank heaven i had got awai from the curs
and the coars joke of the miner and the voic of those basutu
kaffir as thei toil in the sun the memori of which is with me yet
well for some month i dug awai patient at my claim till the veri
sight of a pick or of a washingtrough becam hate to me a hundr
time a dai i lament my own folli in have invest eight hundr
pound which wa about all that i wa worth at the time in thi
goldmin but like other better peopl befor me i had been bitten
by the gold bug and now wa forc to take the consequ i bought a
claim out of which a man had made a fortunef or six thousand pound
at leasta i thought veri cheap that is i gave him five hundr
pound down for it it wa all that i had made by a veri rough
year elephanthunt beyond the zambesi and i sigh deepli and
prophet when i saw my success friend who wa a yanke sweep
up the roll of standard bank note with the lordli air of the man who
ha made hi fortun and cram them into hi breech pocket well i
said to himth happi vendorit is a magnific properti and i onli
hope that my luck will be as good as your ha been
he smile to my excit nerv it seem that he smile omin
as he answer me in a peculiar yanke drawl i guess stranger as i
aint the on to make a man quarrel with hi food more especi when
there aint no more go of the round and as for that there claim
well she been a good nigger to me but between you and me stranger
speak man to man now that there aint ani filthi lucr between us to
obscur the featur of the truth i guess she about work out
i gasp the fellow effronteri took the breath out of me onli five
minut befor he had been swear by all hi godsand thei appear
to be numer and mixedthat there were half a dozen fortun left in
the claim and that he wa onli give it up becaus he wa downright
weari of shovel the gold out
dont look so vex stranger went on my tormentor perhap there
is some shine in the old girl yet anywai you ar a downright good
fellow you ar therefor you will i guess have a real a1 opportun
of work on the feel of fortun anywai it will bring the muscl
up upon your arm for the stuff is uncommon stiff and what is more
you will in the cours of a year earn a sight more than two thousand
dollar in valu of experi
then he went just in time for in anoth moment i should have gone for
him and i saw hi face no more
well i set to work on the old claim with my boi harri and half a dozen
kaffir to help me which see that i had put nearli all my worldli
wealth into it wa the least that i could do and we work my word
we did workearli and late we went at itbut never a bit of gold did
we see no not even a nugget larg enough to make a scarfpin out of
the american gentleman had secur it all and left us the sweep
for three month thi went on till at last i had paid awai all or
veri near all that wa left of her littl capit in wage and food for
the kaffir and ourselv when i tell you that boer meal wa sometim
as high as four pound a bag you will understand that it did not take
long to run through our bank account
at last the crisi came on saturdai night i had paid the men as
usual and bought a muid of meali meal at sixti shill for them to
fill themselv with and then i went with my boi harri and sat on the
edg of the great hole that we had dug in the hillsid and which we
had in bitter mockeri name eldorado there we sat in the moonlight
with our feet over the edg of the claim and were melancholi enough for
anyth present i pull out my purs and empti it content into
my hand there wa a halfsovereign two florin ninep in silver
no coppersfor copper practic doe not circul in south africa
which is on of the thing that make live so dear therein all
exactli fourteen and ninep
there harri my boi i said that is the sum total of our worldli
wealth that hole ha swallow all the rest
by georg said master harri i sai father you and i shall have to
let ourselv out to work with the kaffir and live on meali pap and
he snigger at hi unpleas littl joke
but i wa in no mood for joke for it is not a merri thing to dig
like anyth for month and be complet ruin in the process
especi if you happen to dislik dig and consequ i resent
harri lighthearted
be quiet boi i said rais my hand as though to give him a cuff
with the result that the halfsovereign slip out of it and fell into
the gulf below
oh bother said i it gone
there dad said harri that what come of let your angri
passion rise now we ar down to four and nine
i made no answer to these word of wisdom but scrambl down the steep
side of the claim follow by harri to hunt for my littl all well
we hunt and we hunt but the moonlight is an uncertain thing to look
for halfsovereign by and there wa some loos soil about for the
kaffir had knock off work at thi veri spot a coupl of hour
befor i took a pick and rake awai the clod of earth with it in the
hope of find the coin but all in vain at last in sheer annoy i
struck the sharp end of the pickax down into the soil which wa of a
veri hard natur to my astonish it sunk in right up to the haft
why harri i said thi ground must have been disturb
i dont think so father he answer but we will soon see and
he began to shovel out the soil with hi hand oh he said present
it onli some old stone the pick ha gone down between them look
and he began to pull at on of the stone
i sai dad he said present almost in a whisper it preciou
heavi feel it and he rose and gave me a round brownish lump about
the size of a veri larg appl which he wa hold in both hi hand
i took it curious and held it up to the light it wa veri heavi
the moonlight fell upon it rough and filthencrust surfac and as i
look curiou littl thrill of excit began to pass through me
but i could not be sure
give me your knife harri i said
he did so and rest the brown stone on my knee i scratch at it
surfac great heaven it wa soft
anoth second and the secret wa out we had found a great nugget of
pure gold four pound of it or more it gold lad i said it
gold or im a dutchman
harri with hi ey start out of hi head glare down at the
gleam yellow scratch that i had made upon the virgin metal and then
burst out into yell upon yell of exult which went ring awai
across the silent claim like shriek of somebodi be murder
be quiet i said do you want everi thief on the field after you
scarc were the word out of my mouth when i heard a stealthi
footstep approach i promptli put the big nugget down and sat on it
and uncommonli hard it wa as i did so i saw a lean dark face poke
over the edg of the claim and a pair of beadi ey search us out
i knew the face it belong to a man of veri bad charact known as
handspik tom who had i understood been so name at the diamond
field becaus he had murder hi mate with a handspik he wa now no
doubt prowl about like a human hyna to see what he could steal
is that you unter quatermain he said
ye it i mr tom i answer polit
and what might all that there yell be he ask i wa walk
along atak of the even air and athink on the star when i
ear owl after owl
well mr tom i answer that is not to be wonder at see
that like yourself thei ar nocturn bird
owl after owl he repeat sternli take no notic of my
interpret and i stop and sai that murder and i listen
again and think no it aint that owl is the owl of hexult
some on been and got hi finger into a gummi yeller pot ill swear
and gone off is ead in the suck of them now unter quatermain
is i right is it nugget oh lor and he smack hi lip
audiblygreat big yellow boysi it them that you have just been and
tumbl across
no i said boldli it isntth cruel gleam in hi black ey
altogeth overcom my avers to untruth for i knew that if onc he
found out what it wa that i wa sit onand by the wai i have
heard of roll in gold be spoken of as a pleasant process but i
certainli do not recommend anybodi who valu comfort to try sit
on iti should run a veri good chanc of be handspik befor the
night wa over
if you want to know what it wa mr tom i went on with my politest
air although in agoni from the nugget underneathfor i hold it is
alwai best to be polit to a man who is so readi with a handspikemi
boi and i have had a slight differ of opinion and i wa enforc
my view of the matter upon him that all
ye mr tom put in harri begin to weep for harri wa a smart
boi and saw the difficulti we were in that wa iti hallo becaus
father beat me
well now did yer my dear boydid yer well all i can sai is that
a playedout old claim is a wonder queer sort of place to come to for
to argifi at ten oclock of night and what more my sweet youth if
ever i should av the argifi of yerand he leer unpleasantli at
harryy wont oller in quit such a jolli sort o wai and now ill
be sai goodnight for i dont like disturb of a famili parti
no i aint that sort of man i aint goodnight to yer unter
quatermaingoodnight to yer my argifi young on and mr tom
turn awai disappoint and prowl off elsewher like a human
jackal to see what he could thiev or kill
thank good i said as i slip off the lump of gold now
then do you get up harri and see if that consumm villain ha
gone harri did so and report that he had vanish toward pilgrim
rest and then we set to work and veri carefulli but trembl with
excit with our hand hollow out all the space of ground into
which i had struck the pick ye as i hope there wa a regular nest
of nugget twelv in all run from the size of a hazelnut to that
of a hen egg though of cours the first on wa much larger than
that how thei all came there nobodi can sai it wa on of those
extraordinari freak with stori of which at ani rate all peopl
acquaint with alluvi goldmin will be familiar it turn out
afterward that the american who sold me the claim had in the same wai
made hi pilea much larger on than our by the wayout of a singl
pocket and then work for six month without see colour after
which he gave it up
at ani rate there the nugget were to the valu as it turn out
afterward of about twelv hundr and fifti pound so that after all
i took out of that hole four hundr and fifti pound more than i put
into it we got them all out and wrap them up in a handkerchief and
then fear to carri home so much treasur especi as we knew that
mr handspik tom wa on the prowl made up our mind to pass the
night where we werea necess which disagre as it wa wa
wonderfulli sweeten by the presenc of that handkerchief full of
virgin goldth interest of my lost halfsovereign
slowli the night wore awai for with the fear of handspik tom befor
my ey i did not dare to go to sleep and at last the dawn came i got
up and watch it growth till it open like a flower upon the eastern
sky and the sunbeam began to spring up in splendour from mountaintop
to mountaintop i watch it and as i did so it flash upon me with
a complet convict which i had not felt befor that i had had enough
of goldmin to last me the rest of my natur life and i then and
there made up my mind to clear out of pilgrim rest and go and shoot
buffalo toward delagoa bai then i turn took the pick and shovel
and although it wa a sundai morn woke up harri and set to work
to see if there were ani more nugget about as i expect there were
none what we had got had lain togeth in a littl pocket fill with
soil that felt quit differ from the stiff stuff round and outsid
the pocket there wa not anoth trace of gold of cours it is
possibl that there were more pocket somewher about but all i have
to sai is i made up my mind that whoever found them i should not and
as a matter of fact i have sinc heard that thi claim ha been the
ruin of two or three peopl as it veri nearli wa the ruin of me
harri i said present i am go awai thi week toward delagoa
to shoot buffalo shall i take you with me or send you down to durban
oh take me with you father beg harri i want to kill a
buffalo
and suppos that the buffalo kill you instead i ask
oh never mind he said gaili there ar lot more where i came
from
i rebuk him for hi flippanc but in the end i consent to take
him
chapter ii what wa found in the pool
someth over a fortnight had pass sinc the night when i lost
halfasovereign and found twelv hundr and fifti pound in look
for it and instead of that horrid hole for which after all eldorado
wa hardli a misnom a veri differ scene stretch awai befor us
clad in the silver robe of the moonlight we were campedharri and
i two kaffir a scotch cart and six oxenon the swell side of a
great wave of bushclad land just where we had made our camp howev
the bush wa veri spars and onli grew about in clump while here
and there were singl flattop mimosatre to our right a littl
stream which had cut a deep channel for itself in the bosom of the
slope flow music on between bank green with maidenhair wild
asparagu and mani beauti grass the bedrock here wa red
granit and in the cours of centuri of patient wash the water had
hollow out some of the huge slab in it path into great trough and
cup and these we us for bathingplac no roman ladi with her
bath of porphyri or alabast could have had a more delici spot to
bath herself than we found within fifti yard of our skerm or rough
inclosur of mimosa thorn that we had drag togeth round the cart
to protect us from the attack of lion that there were sever of
these brute about i knew from their spoor though we had neither heard
nor seen them
our bath wa a littl nook where the eddi of the stream had wash awai
a mass of soil and on the edg of it there grew a most beauti old
mimosa thorn beneath the thorn wa a larg smooth slab of granit
fring all round with maidenhair and other fern that slope gentli
down to a pool of the clearest sparkl water which lai in a bowl of
granit about ten feet wide by five feet deep in the centr here to
thi slab we went everi morn to bath and that delight bath is
among the most pleasant of my hunt reminisc as it is also for
reason which will present appear among the most pain
it wa a love night harri and i sat to the windward of the fire
where the two kaffir were busili emploi in cook some impala steak
off a buck which harri to hi great joi had shot that morn and
were as perfectli content with ourselv and the world at larg as two
peopl could possibl be the night wa beauti and it would requir
somebodi with more word on the tip of hi tongu than i have to
describ properli the chasten majesti of those moonlit wild awai for
ever and for ever awai to the mysteri north roll the great bush
ocean over which the silenc brood there beneath us a mile or more to
the right ran the wide oliph and mirrorlik flash back the moon
whose silver spear were shiver on it breast and then toss in
twist line of light far and wide about the mountain and the plain
down upon the riverbank grew great timbertre that through the
still point solemnli to heaven and the beauti of the night lai
upon them like a cloud everywher wa silencesil in the star
depth silenc on the bosom of the sleep earth now if ever great
thought might rise in a man mind and for a space he might forget hi
littl in the sens that he partook of the pure immens about him
hark what wa that
from far awai down by the river there come a mighti roll sound
then anoth and anoth it is the lion seek hi meat
i saw harri shiver and turn a littl pale he wa a plucki boi enough
but the roar of a lion heard for the first time in the solemn bush veldt
at night is apt to shake the nerv of ani lad
lion my boi i said thei ar hunt down by the river there
but i dont think that you need make yourself uneasi we have been here
three night now and if thei were go to pai us a visit i think that
thei would have done so befor thi howev we will make up the fire
here pharaoh do you and jimjim get some more wood befor we go to
sleep els the cat will be pur round you befor morn
pharaoh a great brawni swazi who had been work for me at pilgrim
rest laugh rose and stretch himself then call to jimjim to
bring the ax and a reim start off in the moonlight toward a clump
of sugarbush where we cut our fuel from some dead tree he wa a
fine fellow in hi wai wa pharaoh and i think that he had been name
pharaoh becaus he had an egyptian cast of counten and a royal
sort of swagger about him but hi wai wa a somewhat peculiar wai on
account of the uncertainti of hi temper and veri few peopl could get
on with him also if he could find liquor he would drink like a fish
and when he drank he becam shockingli bloodthirsti these were hi bad
point hi good on were that like most peopl of the zulu blood
he becam exceedingli attach if he took to you at all he wa a
hardwork and intellig man and about as daredevil and plucki
a fellow at a pinch as i have ever had to do with he wa about
fiveandthirti year of ag or so but not a keshla or ring man i
believ that he had got into troubl in some wai in swaziland and the
author of hi tribe would not allow him to assum the ring and
that is why he came to work at the goldfield the other man or rather
lad jimjim wa a mapoch kaffir or knobnos and even in the light of
subsequ event i fear i cannot speak veri well of him he wa an
idl and careless young rascal and onli that veri morn i had to tell
pharaoh to give him a beat for let the oxen strai which pharaoh
did with the greatest gusto although he wa by wai of be veri fond
of jimjim inde i saw him consol jimjim afterward with a pinch
of snuff from hi own earbox whilst he explain to him that the next
time it came in the wai of duti to flog him he meant to thrash him with
the other hand so as to cross the old cut and make a pretti pattern
on hi back
well off thei went though jimjim did not at all like leav the
camp at that hour even when the moonlight wa so bright and in due
cours return safe enough with a great bundl of wood i laugh at
jimjim and ask him if he had seen anyth and he said ye he had
he had seen two larg yellow ey stare at him from behind a bush and
heard someth snore
as howev on further investig the yellow ey and the snore
appear to have exist onli in jimjim live imagin i wa
not greatli disturb by thi alarm report but have seen to the
makingup of the fire got into the skerm and went quietli to sleep with
harri by my side
some hour afterward i woke up with a start i dont know what woke
me the moon had gone down or at least wa almost hidden behind the
soft horizon of bush onli her red rim be visibl also a wind had
sprung up and wa drive long hurri line of cloud across the starri
sky and altogeth a great chang had come over the mood of the night
by the look of the sky i judg that we must be about two hour from
daybreak
the oxen which were as usual ti to the disselboom of the scotch
cart were veri restlessthei kept snuffl and blow and rise
up and ly down again so i at onc suspect that thei must wind
someth present i knew what it wa that thei wind for within
fifti yard of us a lion roar not veri loud but quit loud enough to
make my heart come into my mouth
pharaoh wa sleep on the other side of the cart and look
beneath it i saw him rais hi head and listen
lion inkoo he whisper lion
jimjim also jump up and by the faint light i could see that he wa
in a veri great fright inde
think that it wa as well to be prepar for emerg i told
pharaoh to throw wood upon the fire and woke up harri who i verili
believ wa capabl of sleep happili through the crack of doom
he wa a littl scare at first but present the excit of the
posit came home to him and he grew quit anxiou to see hi majesti
face to face i got my rifl handi and gave harri hisa westlei
richard fall block which is a veri us gun for a youth be
light and yet a good kill rifl and then we wait
for a long time noth happen and i began to think that the best
thing we could do would be to go to sleep again when suddenli i heard
a sound more like a cough than a roar within about twenti yard of
the skerm we all look out but could see noth and then follow
anoth period of suspens it wa veri try to the nerv thi
wait for an attack that might be develop from ani quarter or might
not be develop at all and though i wa an old hand at thi sort of
busi i wa anxiou about harri for it is wonder how the presenc
of anybodi to whom on is attach unnerv a man in moment of danger
i know although it wa now chilli enough i could feel the perspir
run down my nose and in order to reliev the strain on my attent
emploi myself in watch a beetl which appear to be attract
by the firelight and wa sit befor it thoughtfulli rub hi
antenn against each other
suddenli the beetl gave such a jump that he nearli pitch headlong
into the fire and so did we allgav jump i mean and no wonder
for from right under the skerm fenc there came a most fright roara
roar that liter made the scotch cart shake and took the breath out
of me
harri made an exclam jimjim howl outright while the poor
oxen who were terrifi almost out of their hide shiver and low
piteous
the night wa almost entir dark now for the moon had quit set and
the cloud had cover up the star so that the onli light we had came
from the fire which by thi time wa burn up brightli again but
as you know firelight is absolut useless to shoot by it is so
uncertain and besid it penetr but a veri littl wai into the
dark although if on is in the dark outsid on can see it from
far awai
present the oxen after stand still for a moment suddenli wind
the lion and did what i fear thei would dobegan to skrek that is
to try and break loos from the trektow to which thei were ti to rush
off madli into the wilder lion know of thi habit on the part of
oxen which ar i do believ the most foolish anim under the sun
a sheep be a veri solomon compar to them and it is by no mean
uncommon for a lion to get in such a posit that a herd or span of
oxen mai wind him skrek break their reim and rush off into the bush
of cours onc there thei ar helpless in the dark and then the lion
choos the on that he love best and eat him at hi leisur
well round and round went our six poor oxen nearli trampl us to
death in their mad rush inde had we not hastili tumbl out of the
wai we should have been trodden to death or at the least serious
injur as it wa harri wa run over and poor jimjim be caught
by the trektow somewher beneath the arm wa hurl right across the
skerm land by my side onli some pace off
snap went the disselboom of the cart beneath the transvers strain put
upon it had it not broken the cart would have overset as it wa
in anoth minut oxen cart trektow reim broken disselboom and
everyth were soon ti in on vast heav plung bellow and
seemingli inextric knot
for a moment or two thi state of affair took my attent off from
the lion that had caus it but whilst i wa wonder what on earth
wa to be done next and how we should manag if the cattl broke loos
into the bush and were lostfor cattl frighten in thi manner will
so straight awai like mad thingsmi thought were suddenli recal to
the lion in a veri pain fashion
for at that moment i perceiv by the light of the fire a kind of gleam
of yellow travel through the air toward us
the lion the lion holloa pharaoh and as he did so he or rather
she for it wa a great gaunt lioness half wild no doubt with hunger
lit right in the middl of the skerm and stood there in the smoki gloom
lash her tail and roar i seiz my rifl and fire it at her
but what between the confus my agit and the uncertain light
i miss her and nearli shot pharaoh the flash of the rifl howev
threw the whole scene into strong relief and a wild sight it wa i can
tell youwith the seeth mass of oxen twist all round the cart in
such a fashion that their head look as though thei were grow out
of their rump and their horn seem to protrud from their back the
smoke fire with just a blaze in the heart of the smoke jimjim in the
foreground where the oxen had thrown him in their wild rush stretch
out there in terror and then as a centr to the pictur the great gaunt
lioness glare round with hungri yellow ey roar and whine as
she made up her mind what to do
it did not take her long howev just the time that it take a flash
to die into dark for befor i could fire again or do anyth
with a most fiendish snort she sprang upon poor jimjim
i heard the unfortun lad shriek and then almost instantli i saw hi
leg thrown into the air the lioness had seiz him by the neck and
with a sudden jerk thrown hi bodi over her back so that hi leg hung
down upon the further side then without the slightest hesit
and appar without ani difficulti she clear the skerm face at
a singl bound and bear poor jimjim with her vanish into the
dark beyond in the direct of the bathingplac that i have
alreadi describ we jump up perfectli mad with horror and fear and
rush wildli after her fire shot at haphazard on the chanc that
she would be frighten by them into drop her prei but noth
could we see and noth could we hear the lioness had vanish into
the dark take jimjim with her and to attempt to follow her till
daylight wa mad we should onli expos ourselv to the risk of a
like fate
i have known a lion carri a twoyearold ox over a stone
wall four feet high in thi fashion and a mile awai into
the bush beyond he wa subsequ poison by strychnin
put into the carcass of the ox and i still have hi claw
editor
so with scare and heavi heart we crept back to the skerm and sat
down to wait for the dawn which now could not be much more than an hour
off it wa absolut useless to try even to disentangl the oxen till
then so all that wa left for us to do wa to sit and wonder how it
came to pass that the on should be taken and the other left and to
hope against hope that our poor servant might have been mercifulli
deliv from the lion jaw
at length the faint dawn came steal like a ghost up the long slope
of bush and glint on the tangl oxen horn and with white and
frighten face we got up and set to the task of disentangl the
oxen till such time as there should be light enough to enabl us to
follow the trail of the lioness which had gone off with jimjim
and here a fresh troubl await us for when at last with infinit
difficulti we had disentangl the great helpless brute it wa onli
to find that on of the best of them wa veri sick there wa no mistak
about the wai he stood with hi leg slightli apart and hi head hang
down he had got the redwat i wa sure of it of all the difficulti
connect with life and travel in south africa those connect with
oxen ar perhap the worst the ox is the most exasper anim in
the world a negro except he ha absolut no constitut and
never neglect an opportun of fall sick of some mysteri
diseas he will get thin upon the slightest provoc and from mere
malici die of poverti wherea it is hi chief delight to turn
round and refus to pull whenev he find himself well in the centr of
a river or the waggonwheel nice fast in a mud hole drive him a few
mile over rough road and you will find that he is footsor turn him
loos to feed and you will discov that he ha run awai or if he ha
not run awai he ha of malic aforethought eaten tulip and poison
himself there is alwai someth with him the ox is a brute it wa
of a piec with hi accustom behaviour for the on in question to
break outon purpos probablywith redwat just when a lion had
walk off with hi herd it wa exactli what i should have expect
and i wa therefor neither disappoint nor surpris
well it wa no us cry as i should almost have like to do becaus
if thi ox had redwat it wa probabl that the rest of them had it
too although thei had been sold to me as salt that is proof
against such diseas as redwat and lungsick on get harden to
thi sort of thing in south africa in cours of time for i suppos in
no other countri in the world is the wast of anim life so great
so take my rifl and tell harri to follow me for we had to leav
pharaoh to look after the oxenpharaoh lean kine i call them
i start to see if anyth could be found of or appertain to the
unfortun jimjim the ground round our littl camp wa hard and
rocki and we could not hit off ani spoor of the lioness though just
outsid the skerm wa a drop or two of blood about three hundr yard
from the camp and a littl to the right wa a patch of sugar bush
mix up with the usual mimosa and for thi i made think that the
lioness would have been sure to take her prei there to devour it on we
push through the long grass that wa bent down beneath the weight of
the soak dew in two minut we were wet through up to the thigh
as wet as though we had wade through water in due cours howev
we reach the patch of bush and by the grei light of the morn
cautious and slowli push our wai into it it wa veri dark under the
tree for the sun wa not yet up so we walk with the most extrem
care half expect everi minut to come across the lioness lick the
bone of poor jimjim but no lioness could we see and as for jimjim
there wa not even a fingerjoint of him to be found evid thei had
not come here
so push through the bush we proceed to hunt everi other like
spot but with the same result
i suppos she must have taken him right awai i said at last sadli
enough at ani rate he will be dead by now so god have merci on him
we cant help him what to be done now
i suppos that we had better wash ourselv in the pool and then go
back and get someth to eat i am filthi said harri
thi wa a practic if a somewhat unfeel suggest at least it
struck me as unfeel to talk of wash when poor jimjim had been so
recent eaten howev i did not let my sentiment carri me awai so
we went down to the beauti spot that i have describ to wash i wa
the first to reach it which i did by scrambl down the ferni bank
then i turn round and start back with a yella well i might for
almost from beneath my feet there came a most aw snarl
i had lit nearli upon the back of the lioness that had been sleep
on the slab where we alwai stood to dry ourselv after bath with a
snarl and a growl befor i could do anyth befor i could even cock
my rifl she had bound right across the crystal pool and vanish
over the opposit bank it wa all done in an instant as quick as
thought
she had been sleep on the slab and oh horror what wa that
sleep besid her it wa the red remain of poor jimjim ly on a
patch of bloodstain rock
oh father father shriek harri look in the water
i look there float in the centr of the love tranquil pool
wa jimjim head the lioness had bitten it right off and it had
roll down the slope rock into the water
chapter iii jimjim is aveng
we never bath in that pool again inde for my part i could never
look at it peac puriti fring round with wave fern without
think of that ghastli head which roll itself off through the water
when we tri to catch it
poor jimjim we buri what wa left of him which wa not veri much
in an old breadbag and though whilst he live hi virtu were not
great now that he wa gone we could have wept over him inde harri
did weep outright while pharaoh us veri bad languag in zulu and i
regist a quiet littl vow on my account that i would let daylight
into that lioness befor i wa fortyeight hour older if by ani mean
it could be done
well we buri him and there he li in the breadbag which i
rather grudg him as it wa the onli on we had where lion will not
troubl him ani morethough perhap the hyna will if thei consid
that there is enough on him left to make it worth their while to dig
him up howev he wont mind that so there is an end of the book of
jimjim
the question that now remain wa how to circumv hi murderess i
knew that she would be sure to return as soon as she wa hungri again
but i did not know when she would be hungri she had left so littl of
jimjim behind her that i should scarc expect to see her the next
night unless inde she had cub still i felt that it would not
be wise to miss the chanc of her come so we set about make
prepar for her recept the first thing that we did wa to
strengthen the bush wall of the skerm by drag a larg quantiti of
the top of thorntre togeth and lai them on on the other
in such a fashion that the thorn point outward thi after our
experi of the fate of jimjim seem a veri necessari precaut
sinc if where on goat can jump anoth can follow as the kaffir sai
how much more is thi the case when an anim so activ and so vigor
as the lion is concern and now came the further question how were we
to beguil the lioness to return lion ar anim that have a strang
knack of appear when thei ar not want and keep studious out
of the wai when their presenc is requir of cours it wa possibl
that if she had found jimjim to her like she would come back to see
if there were ani more of hi kind about but still it wa not to be
reli on
harri who as i have said wa an emin practic boi suggest to
pharaoh that he should go and sit outsid the skerm in the moonlight as
a sort of bait assur him that he would have noth to fear as
we should certainli kill the lioness befor she kill him pharaoh
howev strang enough did not seem to take to thi suggest
inde he walk awai much put out with harri for have made it
it gave me an idea howev
by jove i said there is the sick ox he must die sooner or later
so we mai as well util him
now about thirti yard to the left of our skerm as on stood face
down the hill toward the river wa the stump of a tree that had been
destroi by lightn mani year befor stand equidist between
but a littl in front of two clump of bush which were sever some
fifteen pace from it
here wa the veri place to tie the ox and accordingli a littl befor
sunset the sick anim wa led forth by pharaoh and made fast there
littl know poor brute for what purpos and we began our long
vigil thi time without a fire for our object wa to attract the
lioness and not to scare her
for hour after hour we wait keep ourselv awak by pinch each
otherit is by the wai remark what a differ of opinion as
to the forc of pinch requisit to the occas exist in the mind of
pincher and pinchedbut no lioness came at last the moon went down
and dark swallow up the world as the kaffir sai but no lion
came to swallow us up we wait till dawn becaus we did not dare to
go to sleep and then at last with mani bad thought in our heart we
took such rest as we could get and that wa not much
that morn we went out shoot not becaus we want to for we
were too depress and tire but becaus we had no more meat for three
hour or more we wander about in a broil sun look for someth
to kill but with absolut no result for some unknown reason the
game had grown veri scarc about the spot though when i wa there two
year befor everi sort of larg game except rhinocero and eleph
wa particularli abund the lion of whom there were mani alon
remain and i fanci that it wa the fact of the game thei live on
have temporarili migrat which made them so dare and feroci as
a gener rule a lion is an amiabl anim enough if he is left alon
but a hungri lion is almost as danger as a hungri man on hear a
great mani differ opinion express as to whether or no the lion is
remark for hi courag but the result of my experi is that veri
much depend upon the state of hi stomach a hungri lion will not stick
at a trifl wherea a full on will flee at a veri small rebuk
well we hunt all about and noth could we see not even a duiker
or a bush buck and at last thoroughli tire and out of temper we
start on our wai back to camp pass over the brow of a steepish
hill to do so just as we climb the crest of the ridg i came to a
stand for there about six hundr yard to my left hi beauti
curv horn outlin against the soft blue of the sky i saw a nobl
koodoo bull strepsicero kudu even at that distanc for as you
know my ey ar veri keen i could distinctli see the white stripe
on it side when the light fell upon it and it larg and point ear
twitch as the fli worri it
so far so good but how were we to get at it it wa ridicul to risk
a shot at that great distanc and yet both the ground and the wind lai
veri ill for stalk it seem to me that the onli chanc would be to
make a detour of at least a mile or more and come up on the other side
of the koodoo i call harri to my side and explain to him what i
thought would be our best cours when suddenli without ani delai the
koodoo save us further troubl by suddenli start off down the hill
like a leap rocket i do not know what had frighten it certainli
we had not perhap a hyna or a leoparda tiger as we call it
therehad suddenli appear at ani rate off it went run
slightli toward us and i never saw a buck go faster i am afraid that
forget harri presenc i us strong languag and realli there
wa some excus as for harri he stood watch the beauti anim
cours present it vanish behind a patch of bush to emerg a
few second later about five hundr pace from us on a stretch of
compar level ground that wa strewn with boulder on it went
clear the boulder in it path with a success of great bound
that were beauti to behold as it did so i happen to look round at
harri and perceiv to my astonish that he had got hi rifl to hi
shoulder
you young donkei i exclaim sure you ar not go toand
just at that moment the rifl went off
and then i think i saw what wa in it wai on of the most wonder
thing i ever rememb in my hunt experi the koodoo wa at the
moment in the air clear a pile of stone with it foreleg tuck
up underneath it all of an instant the leg stretch themselv out
in a spasmod fashion it lit on them and thei doubl up beneath it
down went the nobl buck down upon hi head for a moment he seem to
be stand on hi horn hi hindleg high in the air and then over
he roll and lai still
great heaven i said why youv hit him he dead
as for harri he said noth but mere look scare as well he
might for such a marvel i mai sai such an appal and ghastli
fluke it ha never been my lot to wit a man let alon a boi
might have fire a thousand such shot without ever touch the object
which mind you wa spring and bound over rock quit five
hundr yard awai and here thi ladtak a snap shot and mere
allow for speed and elev by instinct for he did not put up hi
sightshad knock the bull over as dead as a doornail well i made
no further remark as the occas wa too solemn for talk but
mere led the wai to where the koodoo had fallen there he lai
beauti and quit still and there high up about halfwai down hi
neck wa a neat round hole the bullet had sever the spinal marrow
pass through the vertebr and awai on the other side
it wa alreadi even when have cut as much of the best meat as we
could carri from the bull and ti a red handkerchief and some tuft of
grass to hi spiral horn which by the wai must have been nearli
five feet in length in the hope of keep the jackal and aasvgel
vultur from him we final got back to camp to find pharaoh who
wa get rather anxiou at our absenc readi to greet us with the
pleas intellig that anoth ox wa sick but even thi dread
bit of intellig could not dash harri spirit the fact of the
matter be incred as it mai appear i do verili believ that in
hi heart of heart he set down the death of the koodoo to the credit
of hi own skill now though the lad wa a pretti shot enough thi of
cours wa ridicul and i told him so plainli
by the time that we had finish our supper of koodoo steak which
would have been better if the koodoo had been a littl younger it wa
time to get readi for jimjim murderess accordingli we determin
again to expos the unfortun sick ox that wa now absolut on
it last leg be inde scarc abl to stand all the afternoon
pharaoh told us it had been walk round and round in a circl as
cattl in the last stage of redwat gener do now it had come to a
standstil and wa swai to and fro with it head hang down so we
ti him up to the stump of the tree as on the previou night know
that if the lioness did not kill him he would be dead by morn inde
i wa afraid that he would die at onc in which case he would be of but
littl us as a bait for the lion is a sportsmanlik anim and unless
he is veri hungri gener prefer to kill hi own dinner though when
that is onc kill he will come back to it again and again
then we again went through our experi of the previou night
sit there hour after hour till at last harri fell fast asleep and
though i am accustom to thi sort of thing even i could scarc keep
my ey open inde i wa just drop off when suddenli pharaoh gave
me a push
listen he whisper
i wa awak in a second and listen with all my ear from the clump
of bush to the right of the lightningshatt stump to which the sick
ox wa ti came a faint crackl nois present it wa repeat
someth wa move there faintli and quietli enough but still move
percept for in the intens still of the night ani sound seem
loud
i woke up harri who instantli said where is she where is she and
began to point hi rifl about in a fashion that wa more danger to
us and the oxen than to ani possibl lioness
be quiet i whisper savag and as i did so with a low and
hideou growl a flash of yellow light sped out of the clump of bush
past the ox and into the correspond clump upon the other side the
poor sick creatur gave a sort of groan stagger round and then began
to trembl i could see it do so clearli in the moonlight which wa
now veri bright and i felt a brute for have expos the unfortun
anim to such agoni as he must undoubtedli be undergo the lioness
for it wa she pass so quickli that we could not even distinguish her
movement much less fire inde at night it is absolut useless to
attempt to shoot unless the object is veri close and stand perfectli
still and then the light is so decept and it is so difficult to see
the foresight that the best shot will miss more often than he hit
she will be back again present i said look out but for heaven
sake dont fire unless i tell you to
hardli were the word out of my mouth when back she came and again
pass the ox without strike him
what on earth is she do whisper harri
plai with it as a cat doe with a mous i suppos she will kill
it present
as i spoke the lioness onc more flash out of the bush and thi
time sprang right over the doom and trembl ox it wa a beauti
sight to see her clear him in the bright moonlight as though it were a
trick which she had been taught
i believ that she ha escap from a circu whisper harri it
jolli to see her jump
i said noth but i thought to myself that if it wa master harri
did not quit appreci the perform and small blame to him at ani
rate hi teeth were chatter a littl
then came a longish paus and i began to think that the lioness must
have gone awai when suddenli she appear again and with on mighti
bound land right on to the ox and struck it a fright blow with her
paw
down it went and lai on the ground kick feebli she put down her
wickedlook head and with a fierc growl of content buri her
long white teeth in the throat of the dy anim when she lift
her muzzl again it wa all stain with blood she stood face us
obliqu lick her bloodi chop and make a sort of pur nois
now our time i whisper fire when i do
i got on to her as well as i could but harri instead of wait for
me as i told him fire befor i did and that of cours hurri me
but when the smoke clear i wa delight to see that the lioness wa
roll about on the ground behind the bodi of the ox which cover her
in such a fashion howev that we could not shoot again to make an end
of her
she done for she dead the yellow devil yell pharaoh
in exult and at that veri moment the lioness with a sort of
convuls rush halfrol halfsprang into the patch of thick bush
to the right i fire after her as she went but so far as i could see
without result inde the probabl is that i miss her clean at
ani rate she got to the bush in safeti and onc there began to make
such a diabol nois as i never heard befor she would whine and
shriek with pain and then burst out into perfect vollei of roar
that shook the whole place
well i said we must just let her roar to go into that bush after
her at night would be mad
at that moment to my astonish and alarm there came an answer
roar from the direct of the river and then anoth from behind
the swell of bush evid there were more lion about the wound
lioness redoubl her effort with the object i suppos of summon
the other to her assist at ani rate thei came and quickli too
for within five minut peep through the bush of our skerm fenc
we saw a magnific lion bound along toward us through the tall
tambouki grass that in the moonlight look for all the world like
ripen corn on he came in great leap and a gloriou sight it wa to
see him when within fifti yard or so he stood still in an open space
and roar the lioness roar too then there came a third roar and
anoth great blackman lion stalk majest up and join
number two till realli i began to realiz what the ox must have
undergon
now harri i whisper whatev you do dont fire it too riski
if thei let us be let them be
well the pair march off to the bush where the wound lioness
wa now roar doubl tide and the three of them began to snarl and
grumbl awai togeth there present howev the lioness ceas
roar and the two lion came out again the blackman on firstto
prospect i supposewalk to where the carcass of the ox lai and
snif at it
oh what a shot whisper harri who wa trembl with excit
ye i said but dont fire thei might all of them come for us
harri said noth but whether it wa from the natur impetuos of
youth or becaus he wa thrown off hi balanc by excit or from
sheer reckless and devil i am sure i cannot tell you never
have been abl to get a satisfactori explan from him but at
ani rate the fact remain he without word or warn entir
disregard my exhort lift up hi westlei richard and fire
at the blackman lion and what is more hit it slightli on the
flank
next second there wa a most aw roar from the injur lion he
glare around him and roar with pain for he wa badli stung and
then befor i could make up my mind what to do the great blackman
brute clearli ignor of the caus of hi hurt sprang right at the
throat of hi companion to whom he evid attribut hi misfortun
it wa a curiou sight to see the astonish of the other lion at thi
most unprovok assault over he roll with an angri snarl and on to
him sprang the blackman demon and began to worri him thi final
awok the yellowman lion to a sens of the situat and i am bound
to sai that he rose to it in a most effect manner somehow or other
he got to hi feet and roar and snarl frightfulli close with
hi mighti foe
then ensu a most tremend scene you know what a shock thing
it is to see two larg dog fight with abandon well a whole
hundr of dog could not have look half so terribl as those two
great brute as thei roll and roar and rent in their horrid rage
thei grip each other thei tore at each other throat till their
mane came out in hand and the red blood stream down their yellow
hide it wa an aw and a wonder thing to see the great cat
tear at each other with all the fierc energi of their savag
strength and make the night hideou with their heartshak nois
and the fight wa a grand on too for some minut it wa imposs
to sai which wa get the best of it but at last i saw that the
blackman lion though he wa slightli bigger wa fail i am
inclin to think that the wound in hi flank crippl him anywai
he began to get the worst of it which serv him right as he wa the
aggressor still i could not help feel sorri for him for he had
fought a gallant fight when hi antagonist final got him by the
throat and struggl and strike out as he would began to shake the
life out of him over and over thei roll togeth a hideou and
aweinspir spectacl but the yellow on would not loos hi hold
and at length poor blackman grew faint hi breath came in great
snort and seem to rattl in hi nostril then he open hi huge
mouth gave the ghost of a roar quiver and wa dead
when he wa quit sure that the victori wa hi own the yellowman
lion loos hi grip and snif at the fallen foe then he lick the
dead lion ey and next with hi forefeet rest on the carcass
sent up hi own chant of victori that went roll and peal down
the dark path of the night and at thi point i interf take a
care sight at the centr of hi bodi in order to give the largest
possibl margin for error i fire and sent a570 express bullet right
through him and down he drop dead upon the carcass of hi mighti
foe
after that fairli satisfi with our perform we slept peaceabl
till dawn leav pharaoh to keep watch in case ani more lion should
take it into their head to come our wai
when the sun wa well up we aros and went veri cautiouslyat least
pharaoh and i did for i would not allow harri to cometo see if we
could find ani trace of the wound lioness she had ceas roar
immedi upon the arriv of the two lion and had not made a sound
sinc from which we conclud that she wa probabl dead i wa arm
with my express while pharaoh in whose hand a rifl wa inde a
danger weapon to hi companion had an ax on our wai we stop
to look at the two dead lion thei were magnific anim both of
them but their pelt were entir spoil by the terribl maul thei
had given to each other which wa a sad piti
in anoth minut we were follow the blood spoor of the wound
lioness into the bush where she had taken refug thi i need hardli
sai we did with the utmost caution inde i for on did not at
all like the job and wa onli consol by the reflect that it
wa necessari and that the bush wa not thick well we stood there
keep as far from the tree as possibl search and look about
but no lioness could we see though we saw plenti of blood
she must have gone somewher to die pharaoh i said in zulu
ye inkoo he answer she ha certainli gone awai
hardli were the word out of hi mouth when i heard a roar and
start round saw the lioness emerg from the veri centr of a bush in
which she had been curl up just behind pharaoh up she went on to
her hindleg and as she did so i notic that on of her forepaw wa
broken near the shoulder for it hung limpli down up she went tower
right over pharaoh head as she did so lift her uninjur paw to
strike him to the earth and then befor i could get my rifl round or
do anyth to avert the oncom catastroph the zulu did a veri brave
and clever thing realiz hi own immin danger he bound to on
side and swing the heavi ax round hi head brought it down right
on to the back of the lioness sever the vertebr and kill her
instantan it wa wonder to see her collaps all in a heap like
an empti sack
my word pharaoh i said that wa well done and none too soon
ye he answer with a littl laugh it wa a good stroke inkoo
jimjim will sleep better now
then call harri to us we examin the lioness she wa old if on
might judg from her worn teeth and not veri larg but thickli made
and must have possess extraordinari vital to have live so long
shot as she wa for in addit to her broken shoulder my express
bullet had blown a great hole in her middl that on might have put a
fist into
well that is the stori of the death of poor jimjim and how we aveng
it it is rather interest in it wai becaus of the fight between
the two lion of which i never saw the like in all my experi and i
know someth of lion and their manner
and how did you get back to pilgrim rest i ask hunter quatermain
when he had finish hi yarn
ah we had a nice job with that he answer the second sick ox
di and so did anoth and we had to get on as best we could with
three har unicorn fashion while we push behind we did about
four mile a dai and it took us nearli a month dure the last week of
which we pretti well starv
i notic i said that most of your trip end in disast of some
sort or anoth and yet you went on make them which strike on as a
littl strang
ye i dare sai but then rememb i got my live for mani year out
of hunt besid half the charm of the thing lai in the danger and
disast though thei were terribl enough at the time anoth thing
is my trip were not all disastr some time if you like i will
tell you a stori of on which wa veri much the revers for i made
sever thousand pound out of it and saw on of the most extraordinari
sight a hunter ever came across it wa on thi trip that i met the
bravest nativ woman i ever knew her name wa maiwa but it is too late
now and besid i am tire of talk about myself pass the water
