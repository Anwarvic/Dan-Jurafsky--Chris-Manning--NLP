chapter i
you lie you alwai were a liar and you alwai will be a liar you
told my father how i spent the monei
well and what if i did i had to look after myself i suppos you
forget that i am onli here on suffer whilst you ar the son of
the hous it doe not matter to you but he would have turn me out
of door whine georg
oh curs your fine word it you who forget you swab ay it
you who forget that you ask me to take the monei to the gambl
tent and made me promis that you should have half of what we won
but that i should plai for both what ar you begin to rememb
nowi it come back to you after a whole month i am go to
quicken your memori up present i can tell you i have got a good
deal to pai off im think i know what you ar at you want to
plai cuckoo to turn cousin philip out that cousin georg mai fill
the nest you know the old man soft point and you keep work him
up against me you think that you would like the old place when he
goneai and i daresai that you will get it befor you have done but
i mean to have my pennorth out of you now at ani rate and
brush the tear of anger that stood in hi brown ey awai with the
back of hi hand the speaker proceed to squar up to georg in a
most determin wai
now philip with hi broad shoulder and hi firmknit frame would
even at eighteen have been no mean antagonist for a fullgrown man
much more then did he look formid to the lankli overgrown
stripl crouch against the corner of the wall that prevent hi
further retreat
philip your not go to strike me ar you when you know you ar
so much stronger
ye i am though if i cant match you with my tongu at ani rate i
will us my fist look out
oh philip dont ill tell your father
tell him why of cours you will i know that but you shall have
someth to lie about thi time and he advanc to the attack with
a grim determin not pleasant for hi cousin to behold
find that there wa no escap georg turn upon him with so
shrill a curs that it even frighten from hi leafi perch in the oak
abov the tame turtledov intens preoccupi as he wa in coo
to a newfound mate he did more than curs he fought like a corner
rat and with as much chanc as the rat with a train foxterri in
a few second hi head wa as snugli tuck awai in the chanceri of
hi cousin arm as ever ani properti wa in the court of that name
and to speak truth it seem quit possibl that when it emerg
from it retreat it would like the properti be much dilapid and
extens bled
let us not dwell upon the scene for georg it wa a veri pain on
so pain that he never quit forgot it hi nose too wa never so
straight again it wa soon over though to on of the parti time
went with unnatur slow
well i think youv had about enough for onc soliloqu philip
as he critic survei the writh mass on the ground befor him
and he look a veri handsom lad as he said it
hi curli black hair hung in wave confus over hi forehead and
flung chang light and shadow into the depth of hi brown ey
whilst hi massiv and somewhat heavi featur were touch into a
more activ life by the light of that pleas excit which
anim nine men out of everi ten of the anglosaxon race when thei
ar engag on kill or hurt some other live creatur the
face too had a certain digniti about it a littl of the digniti of
justic it wa the face of on who feel that if hi action ha been
precipit and sever it ha at ani rate been virtuou the full but
clearcut lip also had their own express on them half seriou
half comic humour contempt and even piti were blend in it
altogeth philip caresfoot appear in the moment of boyish
vengeanc wa pleas and not uninterest
present howev someth of the same chang pass over hi face
that we see in the sky when a cloud pass over the sun the light
fade out of it it wa astonish to note how dull and heavyai
more how bad it made him look all in a breath
there will be a pretti busi about thi he murmur and then
administ a sharp kick to the prostrat and groan form on the
ground befor him he said now then get up im not go to touch
you again perhap though you wont be in quit such a hurri to tell
li about me anoth time though i suppos that on must alwai
expect a certain amount of ly from a halfbr beggar like you
like mother like son you know
thi last sentenc wa accompani by a bitter laugh and produc a
decid effect on the grovel georg who slowli rais himself
upon hi hand and lift hi head look hi cousin full in the
face
it wa not the ghastli appear of hi mangl and bloodsoak
counten that made philip recoil so sharpli from the sight of hi
own handiworkh had fought too often at school to be chickenheart
about a littl bloodsh and besid he knew that hi cousin wa
onli knock about not realli injuredbut rather the intens and
almost devilish malign of the express that hover on the
blur featur and in the halfclos ey but no attempt wa made
by georg to translat the look into word and inde philip felt
that it wa untranslat he also felt dimli that the hate and
malic with which he wa regard by the individu at hi feet wa of
a more concentr and endur charact than most men have the
power to origin in the lurid light of that on glanc he wa abl
though he wa not veri clever to pierc the darkest recess of hi
cousin heart and to see hi inmost thought no longer through a
veil but face to face and what he saw wa suffici to make the
blood leav hi ruddi cheek and to fix hi ey into an express of
fear
next second georg drop hi head on to the ground again and began
to moan in an ostentati manner possibl in order to attract some
on whose footstep could be plainli heard proceed slowli down a
shrubberypath on the other side of the yard wall at ani rate that
wa the effect produc for next moment befor philip could think of
escap had he wish to escap a door in the wall wa open and a
gentleman paus on the threshold survei the whole scene with
the assist of a goldmount eyeglass with some evid surpris
and littl appar satisfact
the old gentleman for he wa old made so pretti a pictur frame as
he wa in the arch doorwai and set off by a natur background of
vari shade of green that hi gener appear is worth
sketch as he stood to begin with he wa dress in the fashion of
the commenc of thi centuri and as ha been said old though
it wa difficult to sai how old inde so vigor and compar
youth wa hi bear that he wa gener taken to be
consider under seventi but as a matter of fact he wa but a few
year short of eighti he wa extrem tall over six feet and stood
upright as a lifeguardsman inde hi height and state carriag
would alon have made him a remarkablelook man had there been
noth els unusu about him but as it happen hi featur were
as uncommon as hi person thei were clearcut and cast in a nobl
mould the nose wa larg and aquilin the chin like hi son
philip squar and determin but it wa hi ey that gave a
pain fascin to hi counten thei were steeli blue and
glitter under the penthous of hi thick eyebrow that in
strike contrast to the snowwhit of hi hair were black in hue as
temper steel glitter in a curtain room it wa those ey in
conjunct with sundri littl peculiar of temper that had
earn for the old man the titl of devil caresfoot a sobriquet in
which he took peculiar pride so pleas wa he with it inde that
he caus it to be engrav in solid oak letter an inch long upon the
form of a lifes and lifelik portrait of himself that hung over
the staircas in the hous
i am determin he would sai to hi son to be known to my
poster as i wa known to my contemporari the pictur repres
my person not inaccur from the nicknam my descend will be
abl to gather what the knave and fool with whom i live thought of
my charact ah boi i am wear out peopl will soon be stare
at that portrait and wonder if it wa like me in a veri few year
i shall no longer be devil but devil and he would chuckl at
hi grim and illomen joke
philip felt hi father ey plai upon him and shrunk from them
hi face had at the mere thought of the consequ of hi
chastis of hi cousin lost the beauti and anim that had
cloth it a minut befor now it grew leaden and hard the good di
awai from it altogeth and instead of a young god bright with
vengeanc there wa noth but a sullen youth with dull and
frighten ey to hi son as to most peopl who came under hi
influenc devil caresfoot wa a grave realiti
present the pictur in the doorwai open it mouth and spoke in a
singularli measur gentl voic
you will forgiv me philip for interrupt your teteatet but
mai i ask what is the mean of thi
philip return no answer
sinc your cousin is not in a commun mood georg perhap you
will inform me why you ar ly on your face and groan in that
unpleas and aggress manner
georg lift hi bloodstain face from the stone and look at
hi uncl groan louder than ever
mai i ask you philip if georg ha fallen down and hurt himself or
if there ha been ananalterc between you
here georg himself got up and befor philip could make ani repli
address himself to hi uncl
sir he said i will answer for philip there ha been an
alterc and he in the scuffl knock me down and i confess
here he put hi hand up to hi batter face that i am suffer a
good deal but what i want to sai is that i beg you will not blame
philip he thought that i had wrong him and though i am quit
innoc and could easili have clear myself had he given me a
chanc i must admit that appear ar to a certain extent against
me
he li broke in philip sullenli
you will wonder sir went on the bloodstain georg how i
allow myself to be drawn into such a brutal affair and on so
discredit to your hous i can onli sai that i am veri sorri
which inde he wasand that i should never have taken ani notic of
hi wordsknow that he would regret them on reflectionhad he not
in an unguard moment allow himself to taunt me with my birth
uncl you know the misfortun of my father marriag and that she
wa not hi equal in birth but you know too that she wa my mother
and i love her memori though i never saw her and i could not bear to
hear her spoken of like that and i struck him i hope that both you
and he will forgiv me i cannot sai ani more
he li again he cannot speak the truth
philip will you allow me to point out remark hi father in hi
blandest voic that the continu repetit of the veri ugli word
lie is neither narr nor argument perhap you will be so kind
as to tell me your side of the stori you know i alwai wish to be
perfectli imparti
he li to you thi morn about the monei it true enough that i
gambl awai the ten pound at roxham fair instead of pai it into
the bank as you told me but he persuad me to it and he wa to have
share the profit if we won i wa a blackguard but he wa a bigger
blackguard why should i have all the blame and have that fellow
continu shove down my throat as a saint and so i thrash him
and that is all about it
sir i am sorri to contradict philip but inde he is in error the
recollect of what took place ha escap him i could if
necessari bring forward evidencemr bellami
there is no need georg for you to continu and then fix hi
glitter ey on philip it is veri melancholi for me have onli
on son to know him to be such a brute such a bearer of fals
wit such an impostor as you ar do you know that i have just
seen mr bellami the head clerk at the bank and inquir if he knew
anyth of what happen about that ten pound and do you know what
he told me
no i dont and i dont want to
but i realli must beg your attent he told me that the dai
follow the fair your cousin georg came to the bank with ten
pound and told him how you had spent the ten pound i gave you to
pai in and that he brought the monei hi own save to replac
what you had gambl awai and bellami ad that under all the
circumst he did not feel justifi in place it to my credit
what have you to sai to that
what have i to sai i have to sai that i dont believ a word of it
if georg had meant to do me a good turn he would have paid the monei
in and said noth to bellami about it why wont you trust me a
littl more father i tell you that you ar turn me into a
scoundrel i am be twist up into a net of li till i am oblig
to lie myself to keep clear of ruin i know what thi sneak is at he
want to work you into cut me out of the properti which should be
mine by right he know your weak

hi goldhead cane on to the stone what do you mean by that

so fond of call your cousin who is worth two of you a liar now
listen howev imperi i mai have grown in my old ag i can still

the man who deceiv me as i despis you my dear son philipand i
tell you thi and i beg you to lai it to heart that if ever again i
find that you have deceiv me by heaven i will disinherit you in
favour ofoh oh and the old man fell back against the grei wall
press hi hand to hi breast and with the cold perspir
start on to hi pallid counten
both the lad sprang forward but befor thei reach him he had
recov himself
it is noth he said in hi ordinari gentl voic a trifl
indisposit i wish you both good morn and beg you to bear my
word in mind
when he wa fairli gone georg came up to hi cousin and laid hi
hand upon hi arm

but philip onli repli wa to shake him roughli off and to vanish
through the door toward the lake georg regard hi depart form
with a peculiar smile which wa render even more peculiar by the
distort of hi swollen featur
chapter ii
it is difficult to imagin ani studi that would prove more fascin
in itself or more instruct in it issu than the examin of
the lead characterist of individu famili as displai
through a seri of gener but it is a subject that from it
veri natur is more or less unapproach sinc it is but littl
that we know even of our immedi ancestor occasion in glanc
at the crack squar of canva mani of which cannot even boast a
name but which alon remain to speak of the real and activ life the
joi and grief the sin and virtu that centr in the origin of
those hard daub and of ourselv we mai light upon a face that about
six gener sinc wa the counterpart of the littl boi upon our
shoulder or the daughter stand at our side in the same wai too
partli through tradit and partli by other mean we ar sometim
abl to trace in ourselv and in our children the strong develop
of characterist that distinguish the race centuri ago
if local tradit and such record of their individu live as
remain ar worthi of ani faith it is beyond a doubt that the
caresfoot of bratham abbei had hand down their own hard and
peculiar cast of charact from father to son unaffect in the main
by the continu introduct of alien blood on the side of the
mother
the histori of the caresfoot famili had noth remark about it
thei had been yeomen at bratham from time immemori perhap ever
sinc the villag had becom a geograph fact but it wa on the
dissolut of the monasteri that thei first becam of ani
import in the counti bratham abbei which had share the common
fate wa grant by henri viii to a certain courtier sir charl
varri by name for two year the owner never came near hi new
possess but on dai he appear in the villag and ride to the
hous of farmer caresfoot which wa it most respect tenement he
beg him to show him the abbei hous and the land attach it wa
a dark novemb afternoon and by the time the farmer and hi weari
guest had cross the soak land and reach the great grei hous
the damp and shadow of the night had begun to curtain it and to
render it appear forsaken as it wa inexpress dreari and
lonesom
damp here my friend is it not said sir charl with a shudder
look toward the lake into which the rain wa splash
you ar right it be
and lone too now that the old monk have gone
ay but thei do sai that the hous be mostli full of the spirit of
the dead and the yeoman sank hi voic to an aw whisper
sir charl cross himself and mutter i can well believ it and
then address hi companion
you do not know of ani man who would bui an abbei with all it right
and franchis do you friend
not rightli sir the land be so poor it hath no heart in it it doth
scarc repai the tillag and what the hous is you mai see the curs
of the monk is on it but still sir if you have a mind to be rid of
the place i have a littl laid by and a natur love for the land
have been bred on it and taken the colour of my mind and my stubbi
growth therefrom and i will give you and thi astutest of all the
caresfoot whisper a veri small sum into sir charl ear
your price is veri small good friend it doth almost vanish into
noth and methink the land that rear you cannot be so unkind as
you would have me think the monk did not love bad land but yet if
thou hast it in the gold i will take it it will pai off a debt or
two and i care not for the burden of the land
and so farmer caresfoot becam the law owner of bratham abbei with
it two advowson it royal franchis of treasuretrov and deodand
and more than a thousand acr of the best land in marlshir
the same astut that had enabl thi wise progenitor to acquir
the estat enabl hi descend to stick tightli to it and though
like other famili thei had at time met with revers thei never
lost their grip of the abbei properti dure the cours of the first
half of the nineteenth centuri the land increas larg in valu
and it acreag wa consider ad to by the father of the present
owner a man of frugal mind but with the famili mania for the
collect of all sort of plate strongli develop but it wa
philip father devil caresfoot who had dure hi fifti year
tenur of the properti rais the famili to it present opul
condit firstli by a strict attent to busi and the larg
accumul result from hi practic of alwai live upon half
hi incom and secondli by hi marriag late in middl life with
miss bland the heiress of the neighbour isleworth estat that
stretch over some two thousand acr of land
thi ladi who wa philip mother did not live long to enjoi her
wealth and station her husband never spoke a rough word to her and
yet it is no exagger to sai that she di of fear of him the
marriag had been on of conveni not of affect inde poor
anna bland had secretli admir the curat at isleworth and hate mr
caresfoot and hi glitter ey but she marri him for all that to
feel that till she di that glanc wa alwai plai round her like
a rapier in the hand of a skill fencer and veri soon she did die
mr caresfoot receiv her last word and wish with the same
exquisit and unmov polit that he had extend to everi remark
she had made to him in the cours of their marri life have
satisfactorili ei mr caresfoot off into a better world her
husband gave up all idea of further matrimoni ventur and set
himself to heap up rich but a littl befor hi wife death and
just after hi son birth an event had occur in the famili that
had disturb him not a littl
hi father had left two son himself and a brother mani year hi
junior now thi brother wa veri dear to mr caresfoot hi affect
for him wa the on weak point in hi armour nor wa it render ani
the less sincer but rather the more touch by the fact that it
object wa littl better than halfwit it is therefor easi to
imagin hi distress and anger when he heard that a woman who had till
shortli befor been kitchenmaid at the abbei hous and wa now
live in the villag had been confin of a son which she fix upon
hi brother whose wife she declar herself to be investig onli
brought out the truth of the stori hi weakmind brother had been
entrap into a glare mesalli
but mr caresfoot prove himself equal to the occas so soon as hi
sisterinlaw as it pleas him to call her sardon had
suffici recov he call upon her what took place at the
visit never transpir but next dai mr e caresfoot left her nativ
place never to return the child remain with the father or rather
with the uncl that boi wa georg at the time when thi stori open
both hi parent were dead hi father from ill result from
entir failur of brain power the mother from drink
whether it wa that he consid the circumst of the lad birth
entitl him to peculiar consider or that he transfer to him
the affect he bore hi father the result wa that hi nephew wa
quit as dear if not even dearer to mr caresfoot than hi own son
not howev that he allow hi prefer to be appar save in
the neg wai that he wa blind to fault in georg that he wa
suffici quick to note in philip to observ thi partial
seem the more strang when thei thought upon philip bonni face and
form and then note how the weakbrain father and coarseblood
mother had left their mark in georg thick lip small restless
ey pallid complexion and loosejoint form
when philip shook off hi cousin grasp and vanish toward the
lake he did so with bitter wrath and hatr in hi heart for he saw
but too clearli that he had deepli injur himself in hi father
estim and what wa more he felt that so much as he had sunk
hi side of the balanc by so much he had rais up that of georg
he wa inculp a bellami came upon the scene to save georg and
what wa wors an untruth bellami he wa the aggressor and
georg the meek in spirit with the soft answer that turneth awai
wrath it wa intoler he hate hi father he hate georg there
wa no justic in the world and he had not wit to plai rogu with
such a on as hi cousin appear were alwai against him he
hate everybodi
and then he began to think that there wa in the veri next parish
somebodi whom he did not hate but who on the contrari interest
him and wa alwai readi to listen to hi troubl and he also
becam awar of the fact that whilst hi mind had been think hi
leg had been walk and that he wa veri near the abod of that
personalmost at it gate in short he paus and look at hi
watch it had stop at halfpast eleven the on blow that georg
had succeed in plant upon him have land on it to the great
detriment of both the watch and the striker knuckl but the sun
told him that it wa about halfpast twelv not too earli to call so
he open the gate and advanc up an avenu of old beech to a
squar redbrick hous of the time of queen ann boldli rang the
bell
wa miss lee at home ye miss lee wa in the greenhous perhap mr
philip would step into the garden which mr philip did accordingli
how do you do philip im delight to see you youv just come in
time to help in the slaughter

i daresai it is cruel but i dont care grump alwai said that i
had no heart and so far as green fly ar concern grump wa
certainli right now just look at thi lili it is an auratum i gave
threeandsix out of my own monei for that bulb last autumn and now
the bloom is not worth twopenc all through green fly if i were a
man i declar i should swear pleas swear for me philip go outsid
and do it so that i maynt have it on my conscienc but now for
vengeanc oh i sai i forgot you know i suppos i ought to be
look veri sorri
why what the matter ani on dead
oh no so much better than that it got grump
got her what ha got her what is it
why chanceri of cours i alwai call chanceri it i wouldnt
take it name in vain for world i am too much afraid i might be
made to show a caus why and then be lock up for contempt which
frequent happen after you have tri to show a caus that is
what ha happen to grump she is now show a caus shortli she
will be lock up when she come out if she ever doe come out i
think that she will avoid ward in chanceri in futur she will have
too much sympathi with them and too much practic experi of
their posit
but what on earth do you mean maria what ha happen to miss
gregson anglic grump
well you rememb on of my guardian or rather hi wife got it
to appoint her my chaperon but my other guardian want to appoint
somebodi els and after take eighteen month to do it he ha move
the court to show that grump is not a fit and proper person the
idea of call grump improp she nearli faint at it and swore
that whether she live through it or whether she didnt she would
never come within a mile of me or ani other ward if she could help it
not even the ward of an hospit i told her to be care or she
would be commit contempt which frighten her so that she
hardli spoke again till she left yesterdai poor grump i expect she
is on bread and water now but if she make herself half as
disagre to the vicechancellor as she did to me i dont believ
that thei will keep her long shell wear the gaoler out she will
wear the wall out she will wear it down to the bone and then thei
will let her loos upon the world again why there is the bell for
lunch and not a singl green fly the less never mind i will do for
them tomorrow how it would add to her suffer in her lone cell
if she could see us go to a teteatet lunch come on philip
come quick or the cutlet will get cold and i hate cold cutlet
and off she trip follow by the laugh philip who by the wai
wa now look quit handsom again
maria lee wa not veri pretti at her then agejust eighteenbut she
wa a perfect specimen of a young english countri girl fresh as a
rose and sound as a bell and endow besid with a quick wit and a
readi sympathi she wa essenti on of that class of englishwomen
who make the english upper middl class what it ison of the finest
and soundest in the world philip follow her into the hous
thought that she wa charm nor be a caresfoot and therefor
have a consider ey to the main chanc did the fact of her
be the heiress to fifteen hundr a year in land detract from her
charm
the cutlet were excel and maria at three and wa veri comic
about the depart grump inde anybodi not acquaint with the
circumst would have gather that that excel ladi wa to be
shortli put to the question philip wa not quit so merri he wa
oppress both by recollect of what had happen and apprehens
of what might happen

must sai that in thi particular i commend your tast miss lee is a
young ladi of good famili good manner and good mean if her estat
went with thi properti it would complet as pretti a five thousand
acr of mix soil as there is in the counti those ar beauti old
meadow of her beauti perhap but here the old man check
himself
on leav the hous thei had pass togeth down a walk call the
tunnel walk on account of the arch bough of the limetre that
interlac themselv overhead at the end of thi avenu and on the
border of the lake there stood an enorm but still grow oak
known as caresfoot staff it wa the old squir favourit tree
and the best top piec of timber for mani mile round
i wonder said philip by wai of make a littl pleasant
convers why that tree wa call caresfoot staff
your ignor astonish me philip but i suppos that there ar
some peopl who can live for year in a place and yet imbib noth
of it tradit perhap you know that the monk were driven out of
these ruin by henri viii well on the spot where that tree now
stand there grew a still greater oak a giant tree it trunk
measur sixteen load of timber which had as tradit said been
plant by the first prior of the abbei when england wa still saxon
the night the monk left a great gale rage over england it wa in
octob when the tree were full of leaf and it fiercest gust tore
the great oak from it roothold and flung it into the lake look do
you see that rise in the sand there by the edg of the deep pool in
the eight foot water that is there it is suppos to lie well the
whole countrysid said that it wa a sign that the monk had gone for
ever from bratham abbei and the countrysid wa right but when your
ancestor old yeoman caresfoot bought thi place and came to live
here in a year when there wa a great black frost that set the water
of the lake like on of the newfangl road he ask hi
neighbour ay and hi labour folk to come and dine with him and
drink to the success of hi purchas it wa a proud dai for him and
when dinner wa done and thei were all mellow with strong al he bade
them step down to the border of the lake as he would have them be
wit to a ceremoni when thei reach the spot thei saw a curiou
sight for there on a strong drai and drag by farmer caresfoot
six best hors wa an oak of fifti year growth come across the
ic earth root and all
on that spot where it now stand there had been a great hole ten
feet deep by fourteen feet squar dug to receiv it and into that
hole caresfoot staff wa tilt and lever off the drai and when it
had been plant and the frozen earth well trodden in your
grandfath in the ninth degre brought hi guest back to the old
banquetinghal and made a speech which as it wa the first and last
he ever made wa long rememb in the countrysid it wa put
into modern english someth like thi
neighboursprior oak ha gone into the water and folk said
that it wa for a sign that the monk would never come back to
bratham and that it wa the lord wind that put it there and
neighbour as ye know the broad bratham land and the fat marsh
down by the brook pass by king grant to a man that knew not clai
from loam or layer from pasturag and from him thei pass by the
lord will to me as i have ask you here todai to celebr and
now neighbour i have a mind and though it seem to you but a
childish thing yet i have a mind and have set myself to fulfil it
when i wa yet a littl lad and drove the swine out to feed on the
hill yonder when the acorn had fallen afor farmer gyrton father
had graciou leav from the feoffe to put up the fenc that doth now
so sore vex us i found on dai a great acorn as big as a dow
egg and of a rich and wondrou brown and thi acorn i bore home and
plant in kind earth in the corner of my dad garden think that
it would grow and that on dai i would hew it growth and us it for
a staff now that wa fifti long year ago lad and there where grew
prior oak there neighbour i have set my staff todai the monk
have told us how in israel everi man plant hi fig and hi vine for
the fig i know not rightli what that is but for the vine i will
plant no creep cling vine but a hearti english oak that if
thei do but give it good room to breath in and save their heirloom
from the ax shall cast shade and grow acorn and burst into leaf in
the spring and grow nake in the winter when ten gener of our
children and our children children shall have mix their dust
with our yonder in the graveyard and now neighbour i have talk
too long though i am better at do than talk but ye will even
forgiv me for i will not talk to you again though on thi the great
dai of my life i wa mind to speak but i will bid you everi man
pledg a health to the caresfoot staff and ask a prayer that so
long as it shall push it leav so long mai the race of my loin be
here to sit beneath it shade and even mayhap when the corn is ripe
and the moon is up and their heart grow soft toward the past to
talk with kinsman or with sweetheart of the old man who struck it in
thi kindli soil
the old squir face grew tender as he told thi legend of the
forgotten dead and philip young imagin summon up the strang
oldworld scene of the crowd of rustic gather in the snow and frost
round thi veri tree
philip said hi father suddenli you will hold the yeoman staff
on dai be like it of an oaken english heart and you will defi wind
and weather as it ha done and as your forbear have done come we
must go on

a gentleman of your station should be
is georg to go to colleg too
no i have spoken to him on the subject and he doe not wish it he

the time in learn how to earn hi live so he is go to be
articl to the roxham lawyer foster and son or rather foster and
bellami for young bellami who is a lawyer by profess came here
thi morn not to speak about you but on a messag from the firm
to sai that he is now a junior partner and that thei will be veri
happi to take georg as an articl clerk he is a hardwork
shrewd young man and it will be a great advantag to georg to have
hi advic and exampl befor him
philip assent and went on in silenc reflect on the curiou
chang in hi immedi prospect that thi walk had brought to light
he wa much rejoic at the prospect of lose sight of georg for a
while and wa suffici intellig to appreci the advantag
social and mental that the univers would offer him but it struck
him that there were two thing which he did not like about the scheme
the first of these wa that whilst he wa pursu hi academ
studi georg would practic be left on the spotfor roxham wa
onli six mile offto put in motion ani scheme he might have
devis and philip wa sure that he had devis scheme and the
second that oxford wa a long wai from maria lee howev he kept
hi object to himself in due cours thei reach the build
thei had set out to examin and the old squir have settl what
wa to be done and what wa to be left undon with characterist
promptitud and shrewd thei turn homeward

then when the fit took him he would be plung into a state of gloomi
depress that might last for dai hi companion to whom hi
mystic studi were a favourit jest were wont to assert that on
these occas he wa prepar for a visit from hi familiar but
the joke wa on that he never could be prevail upon to appreci
the fact of the matter wa that these fit of gloom were
constitut with him and veri possibl had their origin in the

were colour by her morbid and fanci terror of her husband and
her frantic anxieti to concili him
dure the three year that he spent at colleg philip saw but littl
of georg sinc when he happen to be down at bratham which wa

philip went out of hi father studi consider touch by the
kind and consider with which he had been treat and not a
littl reliev to find hi posit with refer to hi success
to the estat so much better than he had anticip and hi cousin
georg so much wors
that redhair fox ha plot in vain he thought with secret
exult and then he set himself to consid the desir of
fall in with hi father wish as regard marriag of maria he
wa as the reader is awar veri fond inde a few year befor he
had been in love with her or someth veri like it he knew too that
she would make him a veri good wife and the match wa on that in
everi wai commend itself to hi common sens and hi interest ye
he would certainli take hi father advic but everi time he said
thi to himselfand he said it pretti often that eveningther would
aris befor hi mind ey a vision of the sweet blue ey of miss
lee state companion what ey thei were to be sure it made
philip blood run warm and quick mere to think of them inde he
could almost find it in hi heart to wish that hilda wa maria and
maria wa in hilda shoe
what between thought of the young ladi he had set himself to marri
and of the young ladi he did not mean to marri but whose ey he
admir philip did not sleep so well as usual that night
chapter v
philip did not neglect to go to luncheon at rewtham hous and a veri
pleasant luncheon it wa inde it would have been difficult for him
to have said which he found the pleasantest maria cheer chatter
and flatter prefer or hilda sweet and graciou presenc
after luncheon at maria invit he gave fraulein von holtzhausen
her first lesson in write in english charact and to speak truth
he found the task of guid her fair hand through the mysteri of
the english alphabet a by no mean uncongeni occup when he
came awai hi admir of hilda blue ey wa more pronounc than
ever but on the other hand so wa hi convict that he would be
veri foolish if he allow it to interfer with hi intent of
make maria lee hi wife
he who would drive two women thu in doubl har must need have a
light hand and a readi lash and it is certainli to the credit of
philip clever that he manag so well as he did for as time
went on he discov hi posit to be thi both hilda and maria
were in love with him the former deepli and silent the latter
openli and ostens now howev gratifi thi fact might be to
hi pride it wa in some wai a thorni discoveri sinc he dare not
visibl pai hi attent to either for hi part he return hilda
von holtzhausen devot to a degre that surpris himself hi
passion for her burnt him like a fire utterli sear awai the trace
of hi former affect for maria lee under these circumst most
young men of twentyon would have thrown prudenc to the wind and
acknowledg either by act or word the object of their love but
not so philip who even at that ag wa by no mean defici in the
characterist caution of the caresfoot famili he saw clearli that
hi father would never consent to hi marriag with hilda nor to
speak truth did he himself at all like the idea of lose miss lee
and her estat
on the other hand he knew hilda proud and jealou mind she wa no
melt beauti who would sigh and submit to an affront but for all
her graciou wai at heart a haughti woman who if she reign at
all would reign like alexand unrival and alon that she wa
well awar of her friend tendress for philip the latter veri
shortli guess inde as he suspect maria wa in the habit of
confid to her all her hope and fear connect with himself a
suspicion that made him veri care in hi remark to that young
ladi
the earli summer pass awai whilst philip wa still think over hi
posit and the face of the countri wa blush with all the glori
of juli when on afternoon he found himself as he did pretti
frequent in the shadi drawingroom at miss lee as he enter
the sound of voic told him that there were other visitor besid
himself and as soon as hi ey had grown accustom to the light
he saw hi cousin georg togeth with hi partner mr bellami and a
ladi with whom he wa not acquaint
georg had improv in appear somewhat sinc we last saw him
meet with sever treatment at hi cousin hand the face had
fill up a littl with the result that the nose did not look so
hook nor the thick lip so coars and sensual the hair howev
wa as red as ever and as for the small lightblu ey thei
twinkl with the ad sharp and lustr that four year of such
experi of the shadi side of human as can be gather in a
lawyer offic is abl to give to the student of men and manner
so soon as philip had said howdoyoudo to maria and hilda give to
each a gentl pressur of the hand georg greet him with warmth
how ar you philip delight to see you how is my uncl bellami
saw him thi morn and thought that he did not look well
i certainli did think mr philip said the gentleman allud to a
veri younglook applefac littl man with a timid manner who
stood in the background nervous rub hi dry hand togetheri
certainli did think that the squir look ag when i saw him thi
morn

said philip cheerfulli
ye mr philip a good ag a veri good ag for the next heir
and mr bellami chuckl softli somewher down in hi throat and

that for him by the wai philip do you know mr bellami she ha
onli been down here a fortnight you know what no then you have a
pleasur to come rais hi voic so that it might be heard at the
other end of the room a veri clever woman and as handsom as she
is clever
inde i must ask you to introduc me present mr bellami i onli
recent heard that you were marri
mr bellami blush and twist and wa about to speak when georg
cut in again
no i dare sai you didnt sly dog bellami do you know what he did
i introduc him to the ladi when we were up in town togeth last
christma i wa dreadfulli hard hit myself i can assur you and as
soon as my back wa turn he went and cut me out of the waterand
turn my ador into mr bellami
what ar you take my name in vain about mr caresfoot said a
rich low voic behind them
bless me ann how softli you move you quit startl me said
littl mr bellami put on hi spectacl in an agit manner
my dear a wife like an embodi conscienc should alwai be at her
husband shoulder especi when he doe not know it
bellami made no repli but look as though the sentiment wa on of
which he did not approv meantim the ladi repeat her question to
georg and the two fell into a banter convers philip have
drop back a littl had an opportun of carefulli observ mr
bellami an occup not without interest for she wa certainli
worthi of notic
about twenti year of ag and of medium height her figur wa so
fine proport and so roomili made that it gave her the
appear of be taller than she realli wa the head wa set
squar on the shoulder the hair wa cut short and cluster in
ringlet over the low broad brow whilst the clearli carv egyptian
featur and squar chin gave the whole face a curiou express of
resolut and power the ey were heavilylid and greyishgreen
in hue with enorm larg dark pupil that had a strang habit of
expand and contract without appar reason
gaze at her philip wa at a loss to know whether thi woman so
bizarr beauti fascin or repel him inde neither then
nor at ani futur time did he succe in decid the question whilst
he wa still contempl and wonder how bellami of all peopl in
the world had manag to marri such a woman and what previou
acquaint georg had had with her he saw the ladi whisper
someth to hi cousin who at onc turn and introduc him
philip he said let me introduc you to the most charm ladi of
my acquaint mr bellami
philip bow and express himself delight whilst the ladi curtsi
with a mixtur of grace and digniti that becam her infinit well
your cousin ha often spoken to me of you mr caresfoot but he
never told me here she hesit and broke off
what did he never tell you mr bellami noth to my disadvantag
i hope
on the contrari if you wish to know she said in that tone of
flatter frank which is sometim so charm in a woman
mouth he never told me that you were young and handsom i fanci
you forti at least
i should dearli like to tell you mr bellami what my cousin georg
never told me but i wont for fear i should make bellami jealou
jealousi mr caresfoot is a luxuri that my husband is not allow

the onli sort of jealousi i have ani fear of or inde ani respect
for be as it is the express of the natur abhorr of on
woman for anoth i had rather avoid it
philip follow the direct of her sleepi ey and saw that both
miss lee and hilda appear to be put out the former wa talk
absent to mr bellami and glanc continu in the direct of
that gentleman wife the latter too whilst appear to listen to
some compliment from georg wa gaze at mr bellami with a curiou
look of dislik and apprehens in her face
you see what i mean fraulein von holtzhausen actual look as
though she were afraid of me can you fanci ani on be afraid of
me except my husband of coursefor as you know when a woman is
talk of men her husband is alwai except come we must be

a few minut later hilda put down her work and declar that she
felt hot threw open the french window and went out into the garden
whither on some pretext or other philip follow her
what a love woman that is said mr bellami with enthusiasm to
miss lee as soon as philip wa out of earshot her tout ensembl
posit kill on i feel plain and dowdi as a milkmaid alongsid
of a courtbeauti when i am in the room with her dont you miss
lee
oh i dont know i never thought about it but of cours she is
love and im plain so there is no possibl of comparison between
us
well i think you rate yourself rather low if you will allow me to
sai so but most women would but poorli satisfi the sight of a man
when she wa present i know that i should not care to trust my
admir if i had on howev devot he might be for a singl dai
in her compani would you

that beauti is a magnet which attract all men it serv them for a
standard of moral and a test of right and wrong men ar differ
from women if a man is faith to on of us it is onli becaus no
other woman of suffici charm ha becom between him and us you can
never trust a man
what dread idea you have
do you think so i hope not i onli speak what i have observ take
the case of fraulein von holtzhausen for instanc did you not notic
that whilst she wa in the room the ey of the three gentlemen were
all fix upon her and as soon as she leav it on of them follow
her as the other would have done had thei not been forestal on
cannot blame them thei ar simpli follow a natur law ani other
man would do the same where such a charm person is concern
i certainli did not notic it inde to speak the truth i thought
that thei were more occupi with you
with me why my dear miss lee i dont set up for be good
look what a strang idea but i dare sai you ar right it is onli
on of my theori base upon my own casual observ and after
all men ar not a veri interest subject ar thei let talk of
someth more excitingdress for instanc
but poor maria wa too uncomfort and disturb to talk of anyth
els so she collaps into silenc and shortli after mr and mr
bellami and georg made their adieux
meanwhil philip and hilda had been walk leisur down the
shrubberi adjoin the hous
why have you come out she ask in german a languag he understood

simpli that she is in love with you and that you have encourag her
in her affect you need not contradict me she tell me all about
it
nonsens hilda if you will meet me tonight i will explain

she swept round upon him toss her head and stamp her dainti
foot upon the gravel
mr caresfoot she said onc and for all i am not jealou and i
will not meet you i have too much respect for myself and too littl
for you and she wa gone
philip face as he stood look after her wa not pleasant to see
it wa veri hard and angri
jealou is she i will give her someth to be jealou for the
proud minx and in hi vexat he knock off the head of a
carnat with hi stick
philip what ar you do those ar my pet australian carnat

insinu that you were in love with hilda that not true is it
philip dont think me forward if i ask you if that is true and if i
sai that if it is it is better that i should know it i shant be
angri philip and the girl stood befor him to await hi answer on
hand press against her bosom to still the beat of her heart
whilst with the other she screen her blush brow
and philip too stood face to face with her sweet self with
conscienc and with opportun now whisper conscienc is the
time befor veri much harm is done now is the accept time to
tell her all about it and whilst forbid her love to enlist her
sympathi and friendship it will be wrong to encourag her affect
when you ardent love anoth woman you cannot palter ani more
now whisper opportun shoulder conscienc asid is the
time to secur her her love and her possess and to reward hilda
for her pride do not sacrific yourself to an infatu do not
tell her about hildait would onli breed jealousi you can settl
with her afterward take the good the god provid you
all thi and more pass through hi mind and he had made hi choic
long befor the rich blood that mantl in the ladi cheek had sunk
back to the true breast from whenc it came
oh instant of time born to colour all etern to thine own hue for
thi man thou hast come and gone oh fleet moment bear
desol or heal on thy wing how the angel in whose charg
lie the soul of men must trembl and turn pale as thei mark thy

record of hi past
he took her hand the hand that wa press upon her bosom
maria he said you should not get such idea into your head i

chapter vi
it wa some time befor philip could make up hi mind whether or no he
would attend hi tryst with hilda in the first place he felt that it
wa an unsaf proceed gener inasmuch as moonlight meet
with so love a person might should thei come to the knowledg of
miss lee be open to misconstruct and particularli becaus should
she show the least tender toward him he knew in hi heart that
he could not trust himself howev much he might be engag in
anoth direct at twentyon the affect cannot be outrag
with impun but have an awkward wai of assert themselv ti
of honour notwithstand
but as a rule when in our heart we wish to do anyth that thing
must be bad inde if we cannot find a satisfactori excus for do
it and so it wa with philip now thought he to himself would be
hi opportun to inform hilda of hi relat with maria lee and
to put an end to hi flirtat with her for ostens at ani rate
it wa noth more than a veri seriou flirtationthat is to sai
though there had been word of love and even on her part a passion
avow of affect wrung in an unguard moment from the depth of
her proud heart there had been no formal engag it wa a thing
that must be done and now wa the time to do it and so he made up
hi mind to go
but when that night he found himself sit in the appoint place
and wait for the come of the woman he wa about to discard but
whom he love with all the intens of hi fierc natur he began to
view the matter in other light and to feel hi resolut ooz
from him whether it wa the silenc of the place that told upon hi
nerv strain as thei were with expectationfor silenc and more
especi silenc by night is a great unveil of realitiesor the
dread of bitter word or the prescienc of the sharp pang of part
for he knew enough of hilda to know that what he had to sai onc
said she would troubl him no morewheth it wa these thing or
whatev it wa that affect him he grew most unaccount anxiou
and depress moreov in thi congeni condit of the atmospher
of hi mind all it darker and hidden characterist sprang into a
vigor growth superstit and presenti crowd in upon him
he peopl hi surround with the shade of intang deed that
yet await do and grew afraid of hi own thought he would have
fled from the spot but he could not fly he could onli watch the
flicker of the moonlight upon the peac pool besid him andwait
at last she came with quick and anxiou step and though but a few
minut befor he had dread her come he now welcom it eagerli
for our feel of whatev sort when direct toward each other
ar so superfici as compar with the intens of our fear when we
ar terrifi by calam or the presenc real or fanci of the
unknown that in ani moment of emerg more especi if it be of
a mental kind we ar apt to welcom our worst enemi as a drown man
welcom a spar
at last he said with a sigh of relief how late you ar
i could not get awai there were some peopl to dinner and then in
a soften voic how pale you look ar you ill
no onli a littl tire
after thi there wa silenc and the pair stood face on anoth
each occupi with their own thought and each dread to put them
into word onc philip made a begin of speech but hi voic
fail him the beat of hi heart seem to choke hi utter
at length she lean as though for support against the trunk of a
pinetre in the bough of which the night breez wa whisper and
spoke in a cold clear voic
you ask me to meet you here tonight have you anyth to sai to
me no do not speak perhap i had better speak first i have
someth to sai to you and what i have to sai mai influenc whatev
is in your mind listen you rememb what pass between us nearli a
month ago when i wa so weak as to let you see how much i love you
philip bow hi head in assent
veri good i have come here tonight not to give you ani lover
meet but to tell you that no such word must be spoken again and
that i am about to make it imposs that thei should be spoken
either by you or by me i am go awai from here never i hope to
return
go awai he gasp when
here wa the veri thing he hope for come to pass and yet the word
that should have been so full of comfort fell upon him cold as ic
and struck him into miseri
when why tomorrow morn a relat of mine is ill in germani
the onli on i have i never saw him and care noth for him but it
will give me a pretext and onc gone i shall not return i have
told maria that i must go she cri about it poor girl
at these word all recollect of hi purpos pass out of philip
mind all he realiz wa that unless he could alter her
determin he wa about the lose the woman he so passion
ador and whose haughti pride wa to him in itself more charm
than all poor maria gentl love
hilda do not go he said seiz her hand which she immedi
withdrew do not leav me you know how i love you
and why should i not leav you even suppos it to be true that you
do love me to my cost i love you and am i ani longer to endur the
daili humili of see myself the poor german companion who ha
noth but her beauti put asid in favour of anoth whom i also
love you sai you love me and bid me stai now tell me what is your
purpos toward me do you intend to try to take advantag of my
infatu to make me your mistress it is i am told a common thing
for such propos to be made to women in my posit whom it would
be folli for wealthi gentlemen to marri if so abandon that idea for
i tell you philip that i would rather die than so disgrac my
ancient name to gratifi myself i know you moneylov english do not
think veri much of race unless the bearer of the name ar rich but
we do and although you would think it a mesalli to marri me
i on the other hand should not be proud of an allianc with you
why philip my ancestor were princ of royal blood when your still
herd the swine in these wood i can show more than thirti
quarter upon my shield each the mark of a nobl hous and i will
not be the first to put a bar sinist across them now i have spoken
plainli indel perhap and there is onli on more word to be
said between us and that word is goodby and she held out her
hand
he did not seem to see it inde he had scarc heard the latter
part of what she said present he lift hi face and it bore
trace of a dread inward struggl it wa deadli pale and great
black ring had paint themselv beneath the troubl ey
hilda he said hoars dont go i cannot bear to let you go i
will marri you
think of what you ar sai philip and do not be rash i do not
wish to entrap you into marriag you love monei rememb that maria
with all her possess ask noth better than to becom your
wife and that i have absolut noth but my name and my good
look look at me and she step out into a patch of moonlight that
found it wai between the tree and draw the filmi shawl she wore
from her head and bare neck and bosom stood befor him in all the
bright of her beauti shade as it wa and made more love by
the shadow of the night
examin me veri carefulli she went on with bitter sarcasm look
into my featur and studi my form and carriag or you mai be
disappoint with your bargain and complain that you have not got
your monei worth rememb too that an accid an ill and
at the best the passag of a few year mai quit spoil my valu as a
beauti woman and reflect befor i take you at your word
philip had sat or rather crouch himself down upon the log of a tree
that lai outsid the summerhous and cover hi face with hi hand
as though her loveli wa more than he could bear to look upon
now howev he rais hi ey and let them dwell upon her scorn
featur
i had rather he said slowlyi had rather lose my life than lose

nativ tongu that sound so soft upon her lip oh my heart
darl if i could onli trust you as well as i love you it is a
happi woman that i should be tonight
chapter vii
noth occur to interfer with the plan of action decid on by
hilda and philip no misadventur came to mock them dash the
tantalu cup of joi to earth befor their ey on the contrari
within fortyeight hour of the convers record in the last
chapter thei were as complet and irrevoc man and wife as a
special licenc and the curat of a citi church assist by the clerk
and the pewopen could make them
then follow a brief period of such delirium as turn the london
lodg dingi and stuffi as thei were in the height of the hot
summer into an earthli paradis a garden of eden into which ala
the serpent had no need to seek an entranc but as wa natur when
the first glori of realiz happi wa begin to grow faint on
their horizon the young coupl turn themselv to consid their
posit and found in it mutual and sever mani thing that
did not pleas them for philip inde it wa full of anxieti for
he had mani complic to deal with first there wa hi secret
engag to maria lee of which be it rememb hi wife wa
total ignor and which wa in itself a suffici awkward
affair for a marri man to have on hi hand then there wa the
paramount need of keep hi marriag with hilda as secret as the
dead to sai noth of the necess of hi live for the most
part awai from hi wife inde hi onli consol wa that he had
plenti of monei on which to support her inasmuch as hi father had
from the date of hi leav oxford made him an allow of on
thousand a year
hilda had begun to discov that she wa not without her troubl for
on thing her husband fit of moodi and fret anxieti
troubl her and led her possess as she wa with a more than
ordinari share of womanli shrewd to suspect that he wa hide
someth from her but what chiefli vex her proud natur wa the
necess of conceal and all it attend petti falsehood and
subterfug it wa not pleasant for hilda caresfoot to have to pass
as mr robert and to be care not to show herself in public
place in the daytim where there wa a possibl of her be seen
by ani on who might recogn in her strike figur the ladi who had
live with miss lee in marlshir it wa not pleasant to her to be
oblig to repli to maria lee affection letter full as thei
were of entreati for her return by epistl that had to be forward
to a countri town in a remot district of germani to be post and
which were in themselv full of li that howev white thei might
have seem under all the circumst she felt in her conscienc to
be veri black inde in short there wa in their union none of that
sens of final and of secur that is under ordinari
circumst the distinguish mark of marriag in thi countri it
partook rather of the natur of an illicit connect
at the end of a fortnight of wed bliss all these littl thing had
begun to make themselv felt and in truth thei were but the
commenc of evil for on afternoon philip for the first time
sinc hi wed tore himself awai from hi wife side and paid a
visit to a club to which he had been recent elect here he found
no less than three letter from hi father the first request hi
return the second command it in exception polit languag and
the thirdwhich written in mingl anxieti and anger had just
arrivedcoolli announc hi parent intent should he not hear
of him by return of set detect offic to work to discov
hi whereabout from thi letter it appear inde that hi cousin
georg had alreadi been despatch to london to look for him and on
refer to the hall porter he discov that a gentleman answer
to hi descript had alreadi inquir for him sever time
curs hi own folli in not have kept up some commun with
hi father he made the best of hi wai back to hi lodg to find
hilda wait for him somewhat disconsol
i am glad you have come back love she said draw him toward
her till hi dark curl mingl with her own fair lock and kiss
him upon the forehead i have miss you dreadfulli i dont
understand how i can have live all these year without you
i am afraid dear you will have to live without me for a while now
listen and he read her the letter he had just receiv
she listen attent till he had finish
what ar you go to do she ask with some anxieti in her voic
do why of cours i must go home at onc
and what am i to do
well i dont know i suppos that you must stop here
that will be pleasant for me will it not
no dear it will be pleasant neither for you nor me but what can i
do you know the man my father is to deal with if i stop here in
defianc to hi wish especi as he ha been anxiou about me
there is no know what might not happen rememb hilda that we
have to deal with georg whose whole life is devot to secret
endeavour to supplant me if i were to give him such an opportun
as i should by stop awai now i should deserv all i got or
rather all i did not get
hilda sigh and acquiesc had she been a softermind woman she
would have wept and reliev her feel but she wa not soft
mind and so befor the post went out he wrote an affection
letter to hi father express hi sorrow at the latter anxieti at
at hi own neglig in not have written to him the fact of the
matter be he said that he had been taken up with visit some of
hi oxford friend and had not till that afternoon been near hi club
to look for letter he would howev he ad return on the
morrow and make hi apolog in person
thi letter he hand to hi wife to read
do you think that will do he ask when she had finish
oh ye she repli with a touch of her old sarcasm it is a
masterpiec of falsehood
philip look veri angri and fume and fret but he made no repli
and on the follow morn he depart to bratham abbei
ah philip philip said hi father under the mellow influenc of
hi fourth glass of port on the night of hi arriv i know well
enough what kept you up in town well well i dont complain young
men will be young men but dont let these affair interfer with the
busi of life rememb maria lee my boi you have seriou
interest in that direct interest that must not be trifl with
interest that i have a right to expect you will not trifl with
hi son made no repli but sip hi wine in silenc ach at hi
heart for hi absent bride and wonder what hi father would sai
did he realli know what had kept him in town
after thi matter went on smoothli enough for a month or more
sinc fortun for philip the great maria lee question a
question that the more he consid it the more thorni did it appear
wa for the moment shelv by the absenc of that young ladi on a
visit to her aunt in the isl of wight twice dure that month he
manag on differ pretext to get up to london and visit hi
wife whom he found as patient as wa possibl under the
circumst but anyth but happi inde on the second occas
she urg on him strongli the ignomini of her posit and even
beg him to make a clean breast of it to hi father offer to
undertak the task herself he refus equal warmli and some sharp
word ensu to be howev quickli follow by a reconcili
on hi return from thi second visit philip found a note sign
affection your maria lee wait for him which announc
that young ladi return and beg him to come over to lunch on the
follow dai
he wentinde he had no altern but to go and again fortun
favour him in the person of a diffid young ladi who wa stop
with maria and who never left her side all that afternoon much to
the disgust of the latter and the relief of philip on thing
howev he wa not spare and that wa the perus of hilda last
letter to her friend written appar from germani and give a
live descript of the writer daili life and the state of her
uncl health which she said preclud all possibl of her
return ala he alreadi knew it everi line too well for as hilda
refus to undertak the task he had but a week befor draft it
himself but philip wa grow harden to decept and found it
possibl to read it from end to end and specul upon it content
with maria without blush or hesit
but he could not alwai expect to find miss lee in the custodi of such
an obtus friend and needless to sai it becam a matter of veri
seriou import to him to know how he should treat her it occur
to him that hi safest cours might be to throw himself upon her
generos and make a clean breast of it but when it came to the
point he wa too weak to thu expos hi shame conduct to the woman
whose heart he had won and to whom he wa bound by everi tie of
honour that a gentleman hold sacr
he thought of the scorn wonder with which she would listen to hi
tale and prefer to take the risk of greater disast in the futur
to the certainti of present shame in the end he contriv to
establish a speci of confidenti intimaci with maria which whilst
it somewhat mystifi the poor girl wa not without it charm
inasmuch as it tend to transform the everydai philip into a hero of
romanc
but in the main maria wa illsuit to plai heroin to her wooer
hero herself as open as the daylight it wa quit incomprehens
to her why their relationship should be kept such a dark and
mysteri secret or why if her lover gave her a kiss it should be
done with as mani precaut as though he were about to commit a
murder
she wa a veri modest maiden and in her heart believ it a wonder
thing that philip should have fallen in love with hera thing to be
veri proud of and she felt it hard that she should be deni the
gratif of openli acknowledg her lover and show him off
to her friend after the fashion that is so delight to the femal
mind
but though thi conscious of the depriv of a law joi set
up a certain feel of irrit in her mind she did not allow it
to overrid her entir trust in and love for philip whatev he did
wa no doubt wise and right but for all that on sever occas
she took an opportun to make him acquaint with her view of the
matter and to ask him question that he found it increasingli
difficult to answer
in thi wai by the exercis of ceaseless diplomaci and with the
assist of a great deal of falsehood of the most artist natur
philip manag to tide over the next six month but at the end of
that time the posit wa veri far from improv hilda wa chafe
more and more at the ignomini of her posit maria wa daili grow
more and more impati to have their engag made public and
last but by no mean least hi father wa almost daili at him on the
subject of miss lee till at length he succeed in wring from him
the confess that there exist some sort of understand between
maria and himself
now the old squir wa a shrewd man of the world and wa not
therefor slow to guess that what prevent thi understand from
be openli acknowledg as an engag wa some entangl on
hi son part inde it had recent becom clear to him that
london had develop strang attract for philip that thi
entangl could be marriag wa howev an idea that never
enter into hi head he had too good an opinion of hi son common
sens to believ it possibl that he would deliber jeopard hi
inherit by marri without hi permiss but philip
reluct and obstinaci annoi him excess devil caresfoot
wa not a man accustom to be thwart inde he had never been
thwart in hi life and he did not mean to be now he had set hi
heart upon thi marriag and it would have to be a good reason that
could turn him from hi purpos
accordingli have extract the abov inform he said no more
to philip but proceed to lai hi own plan
that veri afternoon he commenc to put them into action at three
oclock he order the carriag and pair a vehicl that wa rare
us give special direct that the coachman should see that hi
wig wa properli curl an illcurl wig had befor now been known
to produc a veri bad effect upon mr caresfoot nerv and also
upon it wearer futur prospect in life
at three precis the heavi open carriag swung upon cspring and
drawn by two huge grei drew up in front of the halldoor and the
squir who wa as usual dress in the oldfashion kneebreech
and carri in hi hand hi goldhead cane step solemnli into
it and seat himself exactli in the middl of the back seat not
lean back as is the fashion of our degener dai but hold
himself bolt upright ani more impos sight than thi old gentleman
present thu seat and move at a state pace through the
villag street it is imposs to conceiv but it so oppress the
veri children that fear at the spectacl which wa an unwont on
for the squir had not thu driven abroad in state for some year
overcam their curios and at hi approach thei incontin fled
so soon as the carriag had pass through the driveg of the
abbei the squir order the coachman to drive to rewtham hous
whither in due cours he safe arriv
he wa usher into the drawingroom whilst a servant went in search
of miss lee whom she found walk in the garden
a gentleman to see you miss

rival wa face to face with that king of terror befor whom all
earthli love hate hope and ambit must fall down and ceas their

within half an hour she wa at the door of the abbei hous where the
doctor met her and in answer to her eager question told her that
humanli speak it wa imposs her friend could live through
anoth twentyfour hour ad an injunct that she must not stai

hair fell around her shoulder enclos her face as in a frame her
pallid counten seem touch with an aw beauti that had not
belong to it in life whilst in her ey wa that dread and
prescient gaze which sometim come to those who ar about to solv

by the side of the bed knelt mr fraser the clergyman of the parish
repeat in an earnest tone the prayer for the dy whilst the
sadfac attend move with muffl tread backward and forward
from the ring of light around the bed into the dark shadow that lai
beyond
when philip came the clergyman ceas prai and drew back into the
further part of the room as did pigott and the nurs the former
take the babi with her
hilda motion to him to come close to her he came and bent over and
kiss her and she with an effort threw on ivori arm around hi
neck and smile sweetli after about a minut dure which she wa
appar collect her thought she spoke in a low voic and in
her nativ tongu
i have not sent for you befor philip for two reasonsfirst

chapter xiii
go my reader if the dai is dull and you feel inclin to moral
for whatev mai be said to the contrari there ar less us
occupationsand look at your villag churchyard what do you see
befor you a plot of enclos ground back by a grei old church a
number of tombston more or less decrepit and a great quantiti of
littl oblong mound cover with rank grass if you have ani
imagin ani power of thought you will see more than that first
with the instinct selfish of human natur you will recogn
your own futur habit perhap your ey will mark the ident
spot where the bodi you love must lie through all season and
weather through the slow centuri that will flit so fast for you
till the crash of doom it is good that you should think of that
although it make you shudder the english churchyard take the place
of the egyptian mummi at the feast or the slave in the roman
conqueror carit mock your vigour and whisper of the end of
beauti and strength
probabl you need some such remind but if give to the inevit
the sigh that is it due you pursu the vein of thought it mai
further occur to you that the plot befor you is in a sens a summari
of the aspir of human it mark the realiz of human
hope it is the crown of human ambit the grave of human
failur here too is the end of the man and here the birthplac of
the angel or the demon it is hi sure inherit on that he never
solicit and never squander and last it is the onli certain
restingplac of sleepless tire mortal
here it wa that thei brought hilda and the old squir and laid them
side by side against the coffin of yeoman caresfoot whose fanci it
had been to be buri in stone and then pile primros and
blackthorn bloom upon their grave left them to their chilli sleep
farewel to them thei have pass to where as yet we mai not follow
violent old man and proud and love woman rest in peac if peac be
the portion of you both
to return to the live the new of the sudden deceas of old mr
caresfoot of the discoveri of philip secret marriag and the death
of hi wife of the term of the old man will under which hilda
be dead and have onli left a daughter behind her georg
inherit all the unentail portion of the properti with the curiou
provis that he wa never to leav it back to philip or hi
children of the sudden departur of miss lee and of mani other
thing that were some of them true and some of them fals follow
as thei did upon the heel of the great dinnerparti and the
announc made thereat threw the countrysid into a state of
indescrib ferment when thi settl down it left a strong and
perman residuum of public indign and contempt direct against
philip the more cordial perhap becaus he wa no longer a rich
man peopl veri rare express contempt or indign against a rich
man who happen to be their neighbour in the countri whatev he mai
have done thei keep their virtu for those who ar impoverish or
for their unfortun relat but for philip it wa felt that there
wa no excus and no forgiv he had lost both hi charact and
hi monei and must therefor be cut and from that dai forward he wa
cut accordingli
as for philip himself he wa fortun as yet ignor of the
kind intent of hi friend and neighbour who had been so fond of
him a week ago he had enough upon hi shoulder without thatfor he
had spoken no lie when he told maria lee that he wa crush by the
dread and repeat blow that had fallen upon him blow that had
rob him of everyth that made life worth live and given him in
return noth but an infant who could not inherit and who wa
therefor onli an incumbr
who is it that sai after all let a bad man take what pain he mai
to push it down a human soul is an aw ghostli uniqu possess
for a bad man to have dure the time that had elaps between the
death and burial of hi father and wife philip had becom thoroughli
acquaint with the truth of thi remark
do what he would he could never for a singl hour shake himself free
from the recollect of hi father death whenev he shut hi
ey hi uneasi mind continu conjur up the whole scene with
uncanni distinct the gloomi room the contort face of the dy
man the red flicker of the firelight on the wallal these thing
were burnt deep into the tablet of hi memori more and more did he
recogn the fact that even should he live long enough to buri the
event of that hour beneath the debri of mani year the laps of
time would be insuffici to bring forget and the recognit
brought with it moral helpless he had too suffici religi
feel to make him uneasi as to hi futur fate and possess a
certain amount of imagin which wa at thi time all direct
toward that aw dai when he and hi dead father must settl their
final account alreadi in the quiet night he would wake with a
start think that the inevit time had come superstiti fear
also would seiz him with their clammi finger and he would shake and
trembl at the fanci step of ghostli feet and hi blood would
curdl in hi vein as hi mind hearken to voic that were for ever
still
and worst of all what had been done and could never be undon had
been done in vain these deadli torment must be endur whilst the
object for which thei had been incur had utterli escap him he
had sold himself to the power of evil for a price and that price had
not been paid but the bond wa good for all that
and so he would brood hour after hour till he felt himself draw
near to mad sometim by a strong effort he would succe in
tear hi mind awai from the subject but then it place wa
instantli fill by a proud form with reproach ey and he would
feel that there too death had put it out of hi power to make
aton of those whom he had wrong maria lee alon surviv and
she had left him in sorrow more bitter than ani anger truli philip
caresfoot wa in melancholi case somewher he had read that the wage
of sin is death but sure what he felt surpass the bitter of
death hi evildo had not prosper with him the snare he had set
for hi father had fallen back upon himself and he wa a crush and
ruin man
it afford a curiou insight into hi charact to reflect that all
these piledup calam all thi wreck and sudden death did not
bring him penit on hi knee befor the maker he had outrag the
crime he had commit especi if unsuccess or the sorrow
that had fallen upon him would have suffic to reduc ninetenth of
ordinari men to a condit of humbl supplic for gener
speak irreligion or rather forget of god is a plant of no
deep growth in the human heart sinc it root ar turn by the rock
of that innat knowledg of a higher power that form the foundat
of everi soul and on which we ar glad enough to set our feet when
the storm of troubl and emerg threaten to destroi us but with
philip thi wa not so he never thought of repent hi wa not
the natur to fall down and sai lord i have sin take thou my
burden from me inde he wa not so much sorri for the past as
fear for the futur it wa not grief for wrongdo that wrung
hi heart and broke hi spirit but rather hi natur sorrow at
lose the onli creatur he had ever deepli love chagrin at the
shame of hi posit and the failur of hi hope and the ici
finger of superstiti fear
the crisi had come and pass he had sin against hi father in
heaven and hi father on earth and he did not sorrow for hi sin hi
wife had left him murmur with her dy lip exhort to
repent and he did not soften shame and loss had fallen upon him
and he did not turn to god but hi pride wa broken all that
remain to him of strength wa hi wicked the flood that had
swept over him had purg awai not the evil but the good from the
evil it onli took it courag henceforth if he sin at all hi will
be no bold and hazard villani which whilst it excit horror can
almost compel respect but rather the low and sordid crime the safe
and treacher iniqu
ajax no longer defi the lightningh mutter curs on it beneath
hi breath
on the even of the doubl funeralwhich philip did not feel equal
to attend and at which georg in a most egregi hatband and
with mani sob and tear offici as chief mournermr fraser
thought it would be a kind act on hi part to go and offer such
consol to the bereav man as lai within hi power if inde he
would accept it somewhat contrari to hi expect he wa on
arriv at the abbei hous ask in without delai
i am glad to see a human face said philip to the clergyman as he
enter the room thi loneli is intoler i am as much alon
as though i lai stark in the churchyard like my poor wife
mr fraser did not answer him immedi so taken up wa he in
notic the wonder chang a week had wrought in hi appear
not onli did hi counten bear trace of the ill and exhaust

mental attitud hi ey had lost the frank bold that had made
them veri pleas to some peopl thei look scare the mouth too
wa render conspicu by the absenc of the firm line that onc
gave it charact inde the man whole appear wa piti and
almost abject
i am afraid he said at length in a tone of gentl compass
that you must have suffer a great deal caresfoot
suffer i have suffer the tortur of the damn i still suffer
them i shall alwai suffer them
i do not wish said the clergyman with a littl hesit to
appear offici or to make a mockeri of your grief by tell you
that it is for your good but i should fail in my duti if i did not
point out to you that he who strike the blow ha the power to heal

in the heydai of hi youth when in the full possess of all hi
capac for enjoy which were larg inde henceforth
everyth that monei could bui would be hi includ the respect

to the overflow cup of hi good fortun by the fact that it had

in enumer my qualiti you omit on ambit
with your look your determin and your brain there is
noth that you will not be abl to do if you set your mind to it
and dont make an enemi of your devot friend
and thu the convers end
now littl bellami had after much anxiou thought just about thi
time come to a bold determinationnam to asset hi marit
author over mr bellami inde hi selfprid wa much injur
by the treatment he receiv at hi wife hand for it seem to him
that he wa utterli ignor in hi own hous in fact it would not be
too much to sai that he wa an entir nonent he had marri mr
bellami for love or rather from fascin though she had noth
in the worldmarri her in a fortnight from the time that georg had
first introduc him when he had walk out of church with hi
beauti bride he had thought himself the luckiest man in london
wherea now he could not but feel that matrimoni had not fulfil hi
expect in the first place love young dreamh wa bare
thirtycam to a rude awaken for onc marri it wa imposs
though he had in common with the major of littl men a
toler good opinion of himselfbut that he should perceiv that
hi wife did not care on brass farth about him to hi soft
advanc she wa as cold as a marbl statu the love ey never
grew tender for him inde he found that she wa wors than a
statu for statu cannot indulg in bitter mockeri and contemptu
comment and mr bellami could and what is more frequent did
it is veri well reflect her husband to marri the loveliest
woman in the counti but i dont see the us of it if she treat on
like a dog
at last thi state of affair had grown intoler and medit
in the solitud of hi offic mr bellami resolv to assert himself
onc and for all and set matter on a proper foot and mr
bellami in her place but it is on thing for husband of the bellami
stamp to form highstomach resolut and anoth for them to put
those resolut into activ and visibl oper on wive of the
mr bellami stamp inde had it not been for a littl incid
about to be detail it is doubt if mr bellami would have ever
come to the scratch at all
when georg had gone mr bellami sat down in by no mean the
sweetest of temper to think but think in thi instanc prove an
unprofit occup and she gave it up in order to admir the
sapphir necklac that lai upon her knee at that moment her husband
enter the room but she took no notic mere go on examin
the stone after move about a littl as though to attract
attent the gentleman spoke
i have manag to get home to lunch my dear
inde
well you might take a littl notic of me
why is there anyth remark about you thi morn
no there is not but remark or not a man who ha been fool
enoughmr bellami laid great emphasi on the word foolto get
marri ha a right to expect when he come into hi own hous that he
will have a littl notic taken of him and not be as complet
overlook asa though he were a tub of butter in a grocer shop
and he pug out hi chest rub hi hand and look defiant
the ladi laid her head back on the chair and laugh with exquisit
enjoy
realli my dear john you will kill me she said at length
mai i ask he repli look as though there wa noth in the
world that he would like better what you ar laugh at
your slightli vulgar but happi simil it is easi to see where you
draw your inspir from if you had onli said butterin inferior
butter you know the counterfeit articl it would have been
perfect
her husband gave a glanc at hi tubbi littl figur in the glass
am i to understand that you refer to me as butterin mr
bellami
oh certainli ye if you like but butter or not you will melt if
you lose your temper so
i have not lost my temper madam i am perfectli cool he repli
posit gasp with furi here hi ey fell upon the necklac
what necklac is that who gave you that necklac i demand to know
you demand to know be care what you sai pleas mr georg
caresfoot gave me the necklac it cost a thousand pound ar you
satisfi
no i am not satisfi i will not have that curs georg caresfoot
continu here i will send him back hi necklac i will assert my
right as an englishman and a spous i will
you will sit down and listen to me
the tone of the voic check hi absurd linguist and physic
caper and caus him to look at hi wife she wa stand and
point to a chair her face wa calm and immov onli her ey
appear to expand and contract with startl rapid on glanc
wa enough for bellami he felt frighten and sat down in the
indic chair
that right she said pleasantli now we can have a cosi chat
john you ar a lawyer and therefor i suppos more or less a man
of the world now as a lawyer and a man of the world i ask you to
look at me and then at yourself and sai if you think it like or
even possibl that i marri you for love to be frank i did noth
of the sort i marri you becaus you were the person most suit to
my purpos if you will onli understand that it will save us both a
great deal of troubl as for your talk about assert yourself and
exercis your author it is simpl nonsens you ar veri well in
your wai my dear john and a fair attornei but do you suppos for
on moment that you ar capabl of match yourself against me if
so you make a shock mistak be advis and do not try the
experi but dont think that the bargain is all my sideit is
not if you will behav yourself properli and be guid by my advic
i will make you on of the richest and most power men in the
counti if you will not i shall shake myself free of you as soon as i
am strong enough rise i must and will and if you will not rise with

rack headach brought on by hi outburst of temper time sometim
bring it reveng and if it doe you mai look out mr bellami
chapter xv
it is perhap time that the reader should know a littl of the ancient
hous and loyalti where mani of the personag of whose histori these
page treat live and move and had their be
the abbei hous so call wa in realiti that part of the monasteri
which had been devot to the us of success gener of prior
it wa like the ruin that lai to it rear entir built of grei
masonri render greyer still by the lichen that fed upon it wall
which were of exceed strength and thick it wa a long
irregular build and roof with old and narrow tile which from
red had in the cours of ag fade to sober russet the banquet
hall wa a separ build at it northern end and connect with
the main dwell by a cover wai the aspect of the hous wa
westerli and the front window look on to an expans of parklik
land heavili timber with oak of larg size some of them pollard
that might have push their first leav in the time of william the
conqueror in spring their vivid green wa diversifi by the reddish
brown of a doubl line of nobl walnuttre a full half mile in
length mark the track of the carriagedr that led to the roxham
highroad
behind the hous lai the wall garden celebr in the time of the
monk as be a fortnight earlier than ani other in the
neighbourhood skirt the southern wall of thi garden which wa a
littl less than a hundr pace long the visitor reach the
scatter ruin of the old monasteri that had for gener serv
as a stone quarri to the surround villag but of which enough wa
left includ a magnific gatewai to show how great had been it
former extent pass on through these he would come to an enclosur
that mark the boundari of the old graveyard now turn to
agricultur us and then to the church itself a build with a
veri fine tower but possess no particular interest if we except
some exceedingli good brass and a coloss figur of a monk cut out
of the solid heart of an oak and suppos to be the effigi of a prior
of the abbei who di in the time of edward i below the church again
and about on hundr and fifti pace from it wa the vicarag a
compar modern build possess no architectur attract
and evid rear out of the remain of the monasteri
at the south end of the abbei hous itself lai a small grass plot and
pleasuregarden fring with shrubberi and adorn with two fine
cedartre on of these tree wa at it further extrem and
under it there ran a path cut through the dens shrubberi thi path
which wa edg with lime and call the tunnel walk led to the
lake and debouch in the littl glade where stood caresfoot staff
the lake itself wa a fine piec of water partli natur and partli
construct by the monk measur a full mile round and from fifti
to two hundr yard in width it wa in the shape of a man shoe
the heel face west like the hous but project beyond it the
narrow part repres the hollow of the instep be exactli
opposit to it and the sole swell out in an easterli direct
bratham abbei wa altogeth a fine old place but the most remark
thing about it wa it air of antiqu and the solemn of it
peac it did not inde strike the spirit with that religi aw
which is apt to fall upon us as we gaze along the vault aisl of
great cathedr but it appeal perhap with equal strength to the
softer and more reflect side of our natur for gener after
gener that hous had been the home of men like ourselv thei
had pass and were forgotten but it remain the sole wit of
the stori of their live hand of which the veri bone had long
sinc crumbl into dust had plant those old oak and walnut that
still don their green robe in summer and shed them in the autumn
to stand great skeleton through the winter month await the
resurrect of the spring
there lai upon the place and it surround a burden of dead live
intang but none the less real the air wa thick with memori
as suggest as the grei dust in a vault even in the summer in the
full burst of natur revel in her strength the place wa sad but
in the winter when the wind came howl through the groan tree
and drove the grei scud across an ashi sky when the bird were dumb
and there were no cattl on the sodden lawn it isol melancholi
wa a palpabl thing
that hoari hous might have been a gatewai of the dim land we call the
past look down in stoni sorrow on the folli of those who so soon
must cross it portal and to the wise who could hear the lesson
pregnant with echo of the warn voic of mani gener
here it wa that angela grew up to womanhood
some nine and a half year had pass from the date of the event
describ in the forego page when on even mr fraser
bethought him that he had been indoor all dai and propos read
till late that night and that therefor he had better take some
exercis
a tall and somewhat nervouslook man with dark ey a sensit
mouth and that peculiar stoop and pallor of complexion which those
devot to much studi almost invari acquir he had student
written on hi face hi histori wa a suffici common on he
possess academ abil of a veri high order and had in hi
youth distinguish himself greatli at colleg both as a classic
and a mathemat scholar when quit young he wa appoint
through the influenc of a relat to hi present live where the
incom wa good and the popul veri small inde freed from all
necess for exert he shut himself up with hi book have hi
littl round of parish work for relax and never sought to emerg
from the quiet of hi aimless studi to struggl for fame and place
in the labori world mr fraser wa what peopl call an abl man
thrown awai if thei had known hi shy sensit natur a littl
better thei would have understood that he wa infinit more suit
for the solitari and peac lot in life which he had chosen than to
becom a unit in the turbul and greedi crowd that is struggl
through all the ag up the slipperi slope of the templ of that
greatest of our godssuccess
there ar mani such men probabl you my reader know on or two
with infinit labour thei store up honei from the field of knowledg
collect endless data from the statist of scienc pile up their
calcul against the veri star and all to no end as a rule
thei do not write book thei gather the learn for the learn
sake and for the veri love of it rejoic to count their labour lost
and thu thei go on from year to year until the golden bowl is broken
and the pitcher broken at the fountain and the gather knowledg
sink or appear to sink back to whenc it came ala that on
gener cannot hand on it wisdom and experiencemor especi
it experienceto anoth in it perfect form if it could we men
should soon becom as god
it wa a mild even in the latter end of octob when mr fraser
start on hi walk the moon wa up in the heaven as he an hour
later made hi wai from the side of the lake where he had been
wander back to the churchyard through which he had to pass to
reach the vicarag just befor he came to the gate howev he wa
surpris in such a solitari spot to see a slight figur lean
against the wall opposit the place where lai the mortal remain of
the old squir and hi daughterinlaw hilda he stood still and
watch the figur appear to be gaze steadili at the grave
present it turn and saw him and he recogn the great grei ey
and golden hair of littl angela caresfoot
angela my dear what ar you do here at thi time of night he
ask in some surpris
she blush a littl as she shook hand rather awkwardli with him
dont be angri with me she said in a deprecatori voic but i wa
so lone thi even that i came here for compani
came here for compani what do you mean
she hung her head
come he said tell me what you mean
i dont quit know myself how can i tell you
he look more puzzl than ever and she observ it and went on
i will try to tell you but you must not be cross like pigott when
she cannot understand me sometim i feel ever so much alon as
though i wa look for someth and could not find it and then i
come and stand here and look at my mother grave and i get compani
and am not lone ani more that is all i know i cannot tell you ani
more do you think me silli pigott doe
i think you ar a veri strang child ar you not afraid to come here
alon at night
afraidoh no nobodi come here the peopl in the villag dare not
come here after dark becaus thei sai that the ruin ar full of
spirit jake told me that but i must be stupid i cannot see them
and i want so veri much to see them i hope it is not wrong but i
told my father so the other dai and he turn white and wa angri
with pigott for give me such idea but you know pigott did not give
them to me at all i am not afraid to come i like it it is so quiet
and if on listen enough in the quiet i alwai think on mai hear
someth that other peopl do not hear
do you hear anyth then
ye i hear thing but i cannot understand them listen to the wind
in the branch of that tree the chestnut off which the leaf is
fall now it sai someth if onli i could catch it
ye child ye you ar right in a wai all natur tell the same
etern tale if our ear were not stop to it voic he
answer with a sigh inde the child talk had struck a vein of
thought familiar to hi own mind and what is more it deepli
interest him there wa a quaint faroff wisdom in it
it is pleasant tonight is it not mr fraser said the littl
maid though everyth is dy the thing die softli without ani
pain thi year last year thei were all kill in the rain and wind
look at that cloud float across the moon is it not beauti i
wonder what it is the shadow of i think all the cloud ar shadow of
someth up in heaven
and when there ar no cloud
oh then heaven is quit still and happi
but heaven is alwai happi
is it i dont understand how it can be alwai happi if we go
there there must be so mani to be sorri for
mr fraser muse a littl that last remark wa difficult to answer
he look at the fleeci cloud and fall into her humour said
i think your cloud is the shadow of an eagl carri a lamb to it
littl on
and i think she answer confid that it is the shadow of an
angel carri a babi home
again he wa silenc the idea wa infinit more poetic than hi
own
thi he reflect is a child of a curiou mental calibr
befor he could pursu the thought further she broke in upon it in
quit a differ strain

chapter xvi
reader we ar about to see angela again and to see a good deal of
her but you must be prepar for a chang in her person appear
for the curtain ha been down for ten year sinc last you met the
child whose odd propens excit pigott wonder and indign
and mr fraser interest and ten year as we all know can work
mani chang in the histori of the world and individu in ten year
some have been swept clean off the board and their place taken by
other a few have grown richer mani poorer some of us sadder some
wiser and all of us ten year older now thi wa exactli what had
happen to littl angelathat is the angela we knew as littl and
ten year make curiou differ between the slim child of nine and
a half and the woman of nearli twenti
when we last saw her angela wa about to commenc her educ let
us reintroduc ourselv on the memor even when after ten
year of studi mr fraser a master by no mean easili pleas
express himself unabl to teach her ani more
it is christma ev drip drop drip fall the rain from the
leafless bough on to the sodden earth the apolog for daylight that
ha been do it dull duti for the last few hour is slowli effac
itself and the gale is celebr the fact and show it joi at
the closingin of the melancholi night by howl it loudest through
the tree and flog the fly scud it ha brought with it from
the sea till it whirl across the sky like a success of ghostli
racehors
thi is outsid the vicarag let us look within in a wellworn arm
chair in the comfort studi near to a tabl cover with book and
hold some loos sheet of foolscap in hi hand sit mr fraser
hi hair is a littl greyer than when he began angela educ
about as grei as rather accommod hair will get at the ag of
fiftythre otherwis hi gener appear is much the same and
hi face as refin and gentlemanlik as ever present he lai down
the sheet of paper which he ha been studi attent and sai
your solut is perfectli sound angela but you have arriv at it
in a characterist fashion and by your own road not but what your
method ha some meritsfor on thing it is more concis than my own
but on the other hand it show a feminin weak it is not
possibl to follow everi step from your premis to your conclus
correct as it is
ah sai a low voic with a happi rippl in it the owner of which
is busi with some teath out of rang of the ring of light thrown
by the doubl readinglamp you often blame me for jump to
conclus but what doe it matter provid thei ar right the
whole secret is that i us the equival algebra formula but
suppress the work in order to puzzl you and the voic laugh
sweetli
that is not worthi of a mathematician said mr fraser with some
irrit it is noth but a trick a tour de forc
the solut is correct you sai
quit
then i maintain that it is perfectli mathemat the object of
mathemat is to arriv at the truth
vox et preterea nihil come out of that corner my dear i hate
argu with a person i cannot see but there there what is the us
of argu at all the fact is angela you ar a firstclass
mathematician and i am onli secondclass i am oblig to stick to
the old track you cut a roman road of your own great master ar
entitl to do that the algebra formula never occur to me when i
work the problem out and it took me two dai to do
you ar try to make me vain you forget that whatev i know
which is just enough to show me how much i have to learn i have
learnt from you as for be your superior in mathemat i dont
think that as a clergyman you should make such a statement here is
your tea and the owner of the voic came forward into the ring of
light
she wa tall beyond the ordinari height of woman and possess
unusu beauti of form that the tightfit grei dress she wore wa
well calcul to displai her complexion which wa of a dazzl
fair wa set off by the dark of the lash that curl over
the deep grei ey the face itself wa round and veri love and
surmount by an ampl forehead whilst her hair which wa twist
into a massiv knot wa of a ting of chestnut gold and mark with
deepset rippl the charm of her face howev did not as is so
often the case begin and end with it physic attract there wa
more much more in it than that but how is it possibl to describ
on paper a presenc at onc so full of grace and digniti of the soft
loveli of woman and of a higher and more spiritu beauti there

she did not answer but draw a stool to a corner of the fireplac
she wipe her ey and sat down almost at hi feet clasp her knee
with her hand and gaze rather sadli into the fire
you have dear angela he began been educ in a somewhat
unusu wai with the result that after ten year of steadi work that
ha been alwai interest though sometim arduou you have
acquir inform deni to the vast major of your sex whilst
at the same time you could be put to the blush in mani thing by a
schoolgirl of fifteen for instanc though i firmli believ that you
could at the present moment take a doubl first at the univers
your knowledg of english literatur is almost nil and your histori
of the weakest all a woman ordinari accomplish such as
draw plai sing have of necess been to a great extent
neglect sinc i wa not abl to teach them to you myself and you
have had to be guid sole by book and by the light of natur in
give to them such time as you could spare
your mind on the other hand ha been daili satur with the
noblest thought of the intellectu giant of two thousand year ago
and would in that respect be as much in place in a welleduc
grecian maiden live befor the time of christ as in an english girl
of the nineteenth centuri
i have educ you thu angela partli by accid and partli by
design you will rememb when you began to come here some ten year
sincey were a littl thing thenand i had offer to give you
some teach becaus you interest me and i saw that you were
run wild in mind and bodi but when i had undertaken the task i
wa somewhat puzzl how to carri it out it is on thing to offer to
educ a littl girl and anoth to do it not know where to
begin i fell back upon the latin grammar where i had begun myself
and so by degre you slid into the curriculum of a classic and
mathemat educ then after a year or two i perceiv your
power of work and your great natur abil and i form a design i
said to myself i will see how far a woman cultiv under
favour condit can go i will patient teach thi girl till
the literatur of greec and rome becom as familiar to her as her
mothertongu till figur and symbol hide no mysteri from her
till she can read the heaven like a book i will teach her mind to
follow the secret wai of knowledg i will train it till it can soar
abov it fellow like a falcon abov sparrow angela my proud
design pursu steadili through mani year ha been at length
accomplish your bright intellect ha risen to the strain i have put
upon it and you ar at thi moment on of the best allround scholar
of my acquaint
she flush to the ey at thi high prais and wa about to speak
but he stop her with a motion of the hand and went on
i have recogn in teach you a fact but too littl known that a
classic educ properli understood is the foundat of all
learn there is littl that is worth sai which ha not alreadi
been beautifulli said by the ancient littl that is worthi of
medit on which thei have not alreadi profoundli reflect save
inde the on great subject of christian medit thi
foundat my dear angela you possess to an emin degre
henceforth you will need no assist from me or ani other man for
to your train mind all ordinari knowledg will be easi to
assimil you will receiv in the cours of a few dai a part
present from myself in the shape of a box of carefulli chosen book on
european literatur and histori devot yourself to the studi of
these and of the german languag which wa your mother nativ
tongu for the next year and then i shall consid that you ar
fairli finish and then too my dear angela i shall expect to reap
a full reward for my labour
what is it that you will expect of me
i shall expect angela and he rose from hi chair and walk up and
down the room in hi excitementi shall expect to see you take your
proper place in your gener i shall sai choos your own line
becom a critic scholar a practic mathematician orand perhap
that is what you ar most suit for with your imagin powersa
writer of fiction for rememb that fiction properli understood and
direct to worthi aim is the noblest and most farreach as it
is also the most difficult of the art in watch the success that
will assuredli attend you in thi or ani other line i shall be ampli
reward for my troubl
angela shook her head with a gestur of doubt but he did not wait for
her to answer
well my dear i must not keep you ani longerit is quit dark and
blow a gale of windexcept to sai on more word rememb that all
thi isindirectli perhap but still none the less trulya mean to
an end there ar two educ the educ of the mind and the
educ of the soul unless you minist to the latter all the time
and toil spent upon the former will prove to littl purpos the
learn will it is true remain but it will be as the quartz out of
which the gold ha been alreadi crush or the dry husk of corn it
will be valueless and turn to no good us will serv onli to feed the
swine of intellectu voluptu and infidel it is believ
me the higher learn of the soul that gild our earthli lore the
loftier object of all educ is so to train the intellect that it
mai becom compet to understand someth howev littl of the
natur of our god and to the true christian the real end of learn
is the appreci of hi attribut as exemplifi in hi mysteri
and earthli wonder but perhap that is a subject on which you ar as
well fit to discours as i am so i will not enter into it
fini my dear fini
angela answer to thi long orat wa a simpl on she rose slowli
from her low seat and put her hand upon mr fraser shoulder
kiss him on the forehead and said
how shall i ever learn to be grate enough for all i ow you what
should i have been now but for you how good and patient you have been
to me

heart and a troubl look came into hi ey thrust her gentli
awai from him he sat down
angela he said present go awai now dear i am tire tonight

and so she went homeward through the wind and storm littl know
that she left her master to struggl with a tempest far more
tremend than that which rage around her
as for him as the door close he gave a sigh of relief
prai god i have not put it off too long he said to himself and
now for tomorrow sermon sleep for the young laughter for the
happi work for old foolswork work work
and thu it wa that angela becam a scholar
chapter xvii
the winter month pass awai slowli for angela but not by ani mean
unhappili though she wa quit alon and miss mr fraser sadli she
found consider consol in hi present of book and in the
thought that she wa get a good hold of her new subject of studi
and then came the wonder of the spring with it rush of bud life
and who least of all angela could be sad in springtim but
nevertheless that spring mark an import chang in our heroin
for it wa dure it sweet hour when have put her book asid
she would roam alon or in compani with her raven through the
flowerstar wood around the lake that a feel of restless
amount at time almost to dissatisfact took possess of her
inde as the week crept on and she drew near the complet of her
twentieth year she realiz with a sigh that she could no longer call
herself a girl and began to feel that her life wa incomplet that
someth wa want in it and thi wa what wa want in angela
life she had if we except her nurs no on to love and she had so
much love to give
did she but guess it the still recess of her heart alreadi trembl
to the footfal of on now draw near out of the multitud of the
live around her a life is mark to mingl with her own she doe
not know it but as the first reflect of the dawn strike the
unconsci sky and shadow the come of it king so the red flush
that now so often spring unbidden to her brow tell of girlhood
twilight end and proclaim the advent of woman life and love

howev so long as no on wa look at them had contract a
concentr stare as though thei were etern gaze at some
object in space and thi appear wa render the more mark by
an appar perman pucker of the skin of the forehead the
moment howev that thei came under the fire of anybodi els
optic and oddli enough more particularli those of hi own
daughter the stare vanish and thei grew shifti and uncertain to a
curiou degre
philip wa emploi in ad up someth when hi daughter enter
and motion to her to sit down she did so and fix her great grei
ey on him with some curios the effect wa remark her father
fidget made a mistak in hi calcul glanc all round the
room with hi shifti ey ah how chang from those bold black ey
with which maria lee fell in love fourandtwenti year ago and
final threw down hi pen with an exclam that would have shock
angela had she understood it
how often angela have i ask you not to stare me out of

poor but as a matter of factand here he sunk hi voic and
glanc suspici roundi am worth at thi moment nearli on
hundr and fifti thousand pound in hard cash
that is six thousand pound a year at four per cent comment
angela without a moment hesit then i realli think you might
put a flue into the old greenhous and allow a shill a week to
mr jake mother
curs mr jake mother nobodi but a woman would have interrupt
with such nonsens listen you must have heard how i wa disinherit
on account of my marriag with your mother and the isleworth estat
left to your cousin georg and how with a refin ingenu he wa
forbidden to bequeath them back to me or to my children but mark
thi he is not forbidden to sell them to me no doubt the old man
never dreamt that i should have the monei to bui them but you see i
have almost enough
how did you get so much monei
get it first i took the gold plate my grandfath bought and sold
it i had no right to do it but i could not afford to have so much
capit ly idl it fetch nearli five thousand pound with thi
i specul successfulli in two year i had eighteen thousand the
eighteen thousand i invest in a fourth share in a coalmin when
monei wa scarc and coal cheap coal rose enorm just then and
in five year time i sold my share to the cohold for eightytwo
thousand in addit to twentyon thousand receiv by wai of
interest sinc then i have not specul for fear my luck should
desert me i have simpli allow the monei to accumul on mortgag
and other invest and bide my time for i have sworn to have
those estat back befor i die it is for thi caus that i have
toil and thought and screw and been cut by the whole
neighbourhood for twenti year but now i think that with your help
my time is come
with my help what is it that you wish me to do
listen answer her father nervous tap hi pencil on the
accountbook befor him georg is not veri fond of isleworthin
fact he rather dislik it but like all the caresfoot he doe not
care about part with land properti and though we appear to be
good friend he hate me too much ever to consent under ordinari
circumst to sell it to me it is to you i look to overcom that
object
i how
you ar a woman and you ask me how you should get the blind side of a
man
i do not in the least understand you
philip smile incredul
then i suppos i must explain if ever you take the troubl to look
at yourself in the glass you will probabl see that natur ha been
veri kind to you in the matter of good look nor ar you by ani mean
defici in brain your cousin georg is veri fond of a pretti
woman and to be plain what i want you to do is to make us of your
advantag to get him under your thumb and persuad him into sell
the properti
oh father how can you ejacul angela in an agoni of shame
you idiot i wont want you to marri him i onli want you to make a
fool of him sure be of the sex you ar you wont find that
an uncongeni occup
angela blush had given awai to pallor now and she answer with
cold contempt
i dont think you quit understand what a girl feelsat least what
i feel for i know no other girl perhap it would be useless for me
to try to explain i had rather go blind than us my ey for such a
shame purpos
angela said her father with as much temper as he ever show now
let me tell you that you ar a silli fool you ar more you ar an
encumbr your birth he ad bitterli rob me of your
mother and the fact of your be a girl depriv our branch of the
famili of their right now that you have grown up you prefer to
gratifi your whim rather than help me to realiz the object of my
life by a simpl cours of action that could do no on ani harm i
never ask you to commit yourself in ani wai well well it is what
i must expect we have not seen much of each other heretofor and
perhap the less we meet in the futur the better
you have no right to talk to me so she answer with flash
ey though i am your daughter and it is cowardli to reproach me
with my birth my sex and my depend am i respons for ani of
these thing but i will not burden you long and as to what you
want me to do and think such a littl of i ask you is it what my
poor mother would have wish her daughter

she is as like her mother as possibl he muse as soon as he wa
clear of the hous it might have been hilda herself onli she is
twice as beauti as hilda wa i shall have anoth bad night after

bear her about me she is a daili remind of thing i dare not
rememb and whenev she stare at me with those great ey of her

brick mansion in the queen ann style about two mile distant from
the abbei and on arriv ask for hi cousin georg and wa at
onc shown into that gentleman presenc
year had told upon georg more than thei had upon philip and though
there were no touch of grei in the flame red of hi hair the
bloodshot ey and the pucker crowsfeet beneath them to sai
noth of the slight but constant trembl of the hand all show
that he wa a man well on in middlelif and who had live everi dai
of it time too had made the face more intens unpleas and
vulgarlook than ever such caresfoot characterist as it

voic if you had live the life that i have for the last twenti
year you would look a littl knock up i have had some veri good

suit you much better

placein fact noth would induc me to do so some dai i mai
marri and want to transmit it to some futur caresfoot but i confess
i dont mean to do that just yet marri when you want a nurs but
never befor that my maxim marriag is an excel institut

to tingl with an unwholesom excit mr snarleyow attent
wa divert by the approach of a dogcart and he left to enjoi the
amus of snap and bark at the hors the cart pull up at
the door and out of it emerg a tall and extrem gentlemanli

chapter xviii
i must apolog for have brought aleck my dog you know with
me began arthur heigham but the fact wa that at the veri last
moment the man i wa go to leav him with had to go awai and i had
no time to find anoth place befor the train left i thought that
if you object to dog he could easili be sent somewher into the
villag he is veri goodtemp though appear ar against
him
oh he will be all right i daresai said georg rather sulkili
for with the except of snarleyow in whose fiendish temper he
found someth refresh and congeni he like no dog but you
must be care or snarleyow my dog will give him a hammer
here good dog good dog and he attempt to pat aleck on the head
but the anim growl savag and avoid him
i never knew him do that befor ejacul arthur in confus
and heartili wish aleck somewher els i suppos he ha taken a
dislik to you dog do sometim you know
next second it struck him that thi wa on of those thing that had
better have been left unsaid and he grew more uncomfort than
ever but at thi veri moment the situat wa render intens
live by the approach of the redoubt snarleyow himself who
have snap at the hors heel all the wai to the stabl had on
hi return to the front of the hous spot aleck from afar he wa
now advanc on tipto in full order of battl hi wickedlook
teeth gleam and hi coat and tail stand out like an angri
bear
arthur alreadi suffici put out about the dog question thought
it best to take no notic and even when he distinctli heard georg
quietli sah on hi dog as he pass him he content himself with
give aleck a kick by wai of a warn to behav himself and enter
into some desultori convers with philip but present a seri
of growl behind him announc that an encount wa immin look
round he perceiv that snarleyow wa stand over the bulldog of
which he wa more than twice the size and hold on to the skin of
hi neck with hi long teeth whilst georg wa look on with
scarc suppress amus
i think mr caresfoot that you had better call your dog off said
arthur goodtemperedli mine is a peaceabl anim but he is an
awkward custom when he doe fight
oh better let them settl it thei will be much better friend
afterward hold him snarleyow
thu encourag the big dog seiz the other and fairli lift him
off the ground shake him violentlya proceed that had the
effect of thoroughli rous aleck temper and then began a most
homer combat at first the bulldog wa dreadfulli maul hi
antagonist size weight and length of leg and jaw to sai noth
of the thick coat by which he wa protect all tell against him
but he took hi punish veri quietli never so much as utter a
growl in strang contrast to the big dog vocifer style of do
busi and at last patienc wa reward by hi enemi forepaw
find it wai into aleck power jaw and remain there till
snarleyow attent to the back of hi neck forc him to shift hi
hold from that time forward the sheepdog had to fight on three leg
which he found demor but still he had the advantag and it
wa not until ani other dog of aleck size would have retreat half
kill that the bulldog superior courag and stamina began to tell
quit heedless of hi injuri and the blood that pour into hi
ey he slowli but sure drove the great sheepdog who by thi time
would have been glad to stop back into an angl of the wall and then
suddenli pin him by the throat down went snarleyow on the top of
the bulldog and roll right over him but when he stagger to hi
leg again hi throat wa still in it cruel grip
take your dog off shout georg see that affair had taken a
turn he veri littl expect
i fear that is imposs repli arthur polit but look
anyth but polit
if you dont get it off i will shoot it
you will do noth of the sort mr caresfoot you set the dog on
and you must take the consequ ah the affair is finish
as he spoke the choke snarleyow whose black tongu wa protrud
from hi jaw gave on last convuls struggl and ceas to
breath satisfi with thi result aleck let go and have snif
contemptu at hi dead antagonist return to hi master side
and sit quietli down began to lick such of hi numer wound
as he could reach
georg when he realiz that hi favourit wa dead turn upon hi
guest in a perfect furi hi face look like a devil but arthur
act with wonder selfpossess for so young a man stop him
rememb mr caresfoot befor you sai anyth that you mai regret
that neither i nor my dog is to blame for what ha happen i am
exceedingli sorri that your dog should have been kill but it is
your own fault i am afraid howev that after what ha happen i
shall be as unwelcom here as aleck so if you will kindli order the
cart for me again i will move on our busi can no doubt be
finish off by letter
georg made no repli it wa evid that he could not trust himself
to speak but turn sullenli on hi heel walk toward the hous
wait a bit mr heigham said philip who had been watch the
whole scene with secret delight you ar perfectli in the right i

chapter xix
arthur sleep wa oppress that night by horribl nightmar of
fight dog whereof the largest and most feroci wa fit with
georg red head the effect of which screw without ani ey to
the fit of thing to the bodi of the deceas snarleyow struck
him as peculiarli disagre he himself wa arm with a gun and
whilst he wa still argu with sir john bellami the nice point
whether should he execut that particular anim as he felt a carnal
long to do it would be manslaught or dogslaught he found
himself wide awak
it wa veri earli in the morn of the 1st of mai and contrari to
the usual experi of the inhabit of these island the sky gave
promis of a particularli fine dai just the dai for fish he did
not feel sleepi and had he done so he had had enough of hi doggi
dream so he got up dress and take hi fishingrod let himself
out of the hous as he had been instruct to do on the previou
even and releas aleck from hi outhous proceed toward
bratham lake
and about thi time angela woke up too for she alwai rose earli and
ran to the window to see what sort of a dai she had got for her
birthdai see it to be so fine she threw open the old lattic at
which her pet raven jack wa alreadi tap to be admit and let
the sweet air plai upon her face and neck and thought what a
wonder thing it wa to be twenti year old and then kneel by
the window she said her prayer after her own fashion thank god
who had spare her to see thi dai and prai him to show her what
to do with her life and if it wa hi will to make it a littl less
lone then she rose and dress herself feel that now that she
had done with her teen she wa in everi respect a woman grown
inde quit old and in honour of the event she chose out of her
scanti store of dress all of them made by pigott and herself her
veri prettiest the on she had had for sundai wear last summer a
tightfit robe of white stuff with soft littl frill round the
neck and wrist next she put on a pair of stout boot calcul to
keep out the morn dew and start off
now all thi had taken a good time nearli an hour perhap for be
her birthdai and there have been some mention of a young gentleman
who might possibl come to fish she had plait up her shine hair
with extra care a veri labori busi when your hair hang down
to your knee
meanwhil our other earli riser arthur had made hi wai first to the
foot of the lake and then along the littl path that skirt it area
till he came to caresfoot staff have suffici admir that
majest oak for he wa a great lover of timber he proceed to
investig the surround water with the ey of a true fisherman a
few yard further up there jut into the water that fragment of wall
on which stood the post now quit rotten to which angela had bound
herself on the dai of the great storm at hi feet too the
foundat of anoth wall ran out for some distanc into the lake
be doubtless the underpin of an ancient boathous but thi
did not rise out of the water but stop within six inch of the
surfac between these two wall lai a veri deep pool
just the place for a heavi fish reflect arthur and even as he
thought it he saw a fivepound carp rise nearli to the surfac in
order to clear the obstruct of the wall and sink silent into the
depth
retir carefulli to on of two quaintli carven stone block place
at the foot of the oaktre on which doubtless mani a monk had sat
in medit he set himself to get hi fishinggear togeth
present howev struck by the beauti of the spot and it quiet
onli broken by the song of mani nest bird he stop a while to
look around him abov hi head the branch of a great oak now
cloth themselv with the most vivid green form a domelik
roof beneath the shade of which grew the softest moss star here
and there with primros and violet outsid the circl of it shadow
the brushwood of mingl hazel and ashstub rose thick and high
ringingin the littl spot as with a wall except where it depth
were pierc by the passag of a long green lane of lime that unlik
the shrubberi appear to be kept in care order and of which
the arch bough form a perfect leafi tunnel befor him lai the
lake where the long morn light quiver and danc as it calm
wa now and again ruffl by a gentl breez the whole scene had a
love and peac look and gaze on it arthur fell into a
reveri
sit thu dreamili hi face look at it best it express of
gentl thought give it an attract beyond what it wa
entitl to judg pure from a sculptor point of view it wa an
intellectu face a face that gave sign of great mental
possibl but for all that a littl weak about the mouth the
brow indic some degre of power and the mouth and ey no small
capac for affect and all sort of human sympathi and kind
these last in vari light could chang as often as the english
climat their groundwork howev wa blue and thei were honest and
bonni in short a man in look at arthur heigham at the ag of
twentyfour would have reflect that even among english gentlemen
he wa remark for hi gentlemanlik appear and a fellow on
would like to know a girl would have dub him nicelook and
a middleag womanand most women do not realli understand the
immens differ between men until thei ar get on that wai
would have recogn in him a young man by no mean uninterest
and on who might accord to the circumst of hi life develop
into anyth ornoth in particular
present drawn by some unguess attract arthur took hi ey
off an industri waterhen who wa build a nest in a hurri
wai as though she were not quit sure of hi intent and
perceiv a larg raven stand on on leg on the grass about three
yard from him and peer at him comic out of on ey thi wa
odd but hi glanc did not stop at the raven for a yard or two
beyond it he caught sight of a white skirt and hi ey travel
upward saw first a round waist and then a bust and pair of
shoulder such as few women can boast and at last anoth pair of
ey and he then and there fell utterli and irretriev in love
good heaven he said aloudpoor fellow he did not mean to sai
it it wa wrung from the depth of hi heartgood heaven how
love she is
let the reader imagin the dread confus produc in that other
pair of ey at the open express of such a sentiment and the vivid
blush that stain the fair face in which thei were set if he can
but somehow thei did not grow angryperhap it wa not in the natur
of the most sternli repress young ladi to grow angri at a
compliment which howev mark wa so evid genuin and
unpremedit in anoth moment arthur bethought him of what he had
said and it wa hi turn to blush he recov himself pretti well
howev rise from hi stone seat he took off hi hat and said
humbl
i beg your pardon but you startl me so and realli for a moment i
thought that you were the spirit of the place or he ad
gracefulli point to a branch of halfopen hawthorn bloom she
held in her hand the origin queen of the mai
angela blush again the compliment wa onli impli thi time she
had therefor no possibl pretext for get angri
for a moment she drop the sweet ey that look as though thei
were fresh from read the truth of heaven befor hi gaze of
unmistak admir and stood confus and as she stood it
struck arthur that there wa someth more than mere beauti of form
and featur about heran indescrib someth a glori of
innoc a reflect of god own light that ting the worship her
loveli command with a touch of reverenti aw
the angel must look like that he thought but he had no time to
think ani more for next moment she had gather up her courag in
both her hand and wa speak to him in a soft voic of which the
tone went ring on through all the chang of hi life
my father told me that he had ask you to come and fish but i did
not expect to meet you so earli ii fear that i am disturb you
and she made as though she would be go
arthur felt that thi wa a conting to be prevent at all
hazard

i am veri sorri to hear that she said i hope you were go to

and so i might have had it not been for that brute aleck but he ha
put a long sojourn with your cousin and the ghost of snarleyow out of
the question so i suppos i must go by the 620 train at ani rate
he ad more brightli as a thought struck him i must go from

she did not appear to see the drift of the last part of hi remark
but answer
i am go with my father to call at isleworth at three thi
afternoon so perhap we shall meet again there but now befor i go

up where jake our garden alwai set hi nightlin
arthur assent as he would have been glad to assent to anyth
like to prolong the interview and thei walk off slowli togeth

to an end would allow the spot wa reach all too soon and angela
with evid reluct for she wa not accustom to conceal her

why did you not ask him in to breakfast he said
becaus there is noth to eat except bread and milk
ahwel perhap you were right i will go down and speak to him
no i forgot i shall see him thi afternoon
and arthur let those who disbeliev in love at first sight laugh if
thei will sat down to think trembl in everi limb utterli shaken
by the inrush of a new and strong emot he had not come to the ag
of twentyfour without some experi of the other sex but never
befor had he known ani such sensat as that which now overpow
him never befor had he fulli realiz what solitud meant as he did
now that she had left him in youth when love doe come he come as
a strong man arm
and so steadi and overwhelm all resist the full tide of a
pure passion pour itself into hi heart there wa no pretenc or
makebeliev about it the bold that sped from angela grei ey had
gone straight home and would remain an everfix mark so long as
life itself should last
for onli onc in a lifetim doe a man succumb after thi fashion to
mani inde no such fortunecal it good or illwil ever come
sinc the major of men flirt or marri indulg in platon
friendship or in a consist cours of admir of their
neighbour wive as fate or fanci lead them and wear their time
awai without ever have known the mean of such love as thi there
is no fix rule about it the most unlik even the more sordid and
contempt of mankind ar liabl to becom the subject of an
endur passion onli then it rais them for though strong
affect especi if unrequit sometim wear and enerv
the mind it influenc is in the main undoubtedli ennobl but
though such affect is bound by no rule it is curiou to observ
how gener true ar the old sai which declar that a man
thought return to hi first real love as natur and unconsci
as the needl that ha for a while been drawn asid by some
overmast influenc return to it magnet pole the needl ha
waver but it ha never shaken off it allegi that would be
against natur and is therefor imposs and so it is with the
heart it is the ev that he love as a lad which he see through the
gather dark of hi deathb it is a chanc but that he will
alwai ador the star which first came to share hi loneli in thi
shadow world abov all the shine multitud in heaven
and though it is not everi watcher who will find it earli or late
that star mai rise for him as it did for arthur now a man mai meet a
face which it is quit beyond hi power to forget and be touch of
lip that print their kiss upon hi veri heart ye the star mai
rise to pursu it cours perhap beyond the ken of hi horizon or
onli to set again befor he ha learnt to understand it beauti
rare veri rare to shed it perfect light upon him for all hi
time of watch the star mai rise and set the sweet lip whose
touch still thrill him after so mani year mai lie todai
beyond the graveyard barren wall
or wors still have sinc been sold to some richer owner but if
onc it ha risen if onc those lip have met the memori must
remain the soul know no forget and the littl thread of
life spun out will it not claim it own for the compact that it ha
seal is holi among holi thing that love which it ha given is of
it own natur and not of the bodi aloneit is inscrut as death
and everlast as the heaven
ye the fiat ha gone forth for good or for evil for comfort or for
scorn for the world and for etern he love her henceforth that
love so lightli and yet so irredeem given will becom the
guid spirit of hi inner life roughhew hi destini
direct hi end and shoot it memori and hope through the
whole fabric of hi be like an interwoven thread of gold he mai
sin against it but he can never forget it other interest and ti
mai overlai it but thei cannot extinguish it he mai drown it
fragranc in voluptu scent but when these have satiat and
becom hate it will rearis pure and sweet as ever time or
separ cannot destroi itfor it is immort us cannot stale it
pain can onli sanctifi it it will be to him as a beaconlight to the
seaworn marin that tell of home and peac upon the shore as a
rainbowpromis set upon the sky it alon of all thing pertain to
him will defi the attack of the consum year and when old and
wither he lai him down to die it will at last present itself
befor hi glaze ey an embodi joi clad in shine robe and
breath the air of paradis
for such is love to those to whom it ha been given to see him face to

chapter xxii
the dogcart that arthur had hire to take him awai belong to an
oldfashion inn in the parish of rewtham situat about a mile from
rewtham hous which had just pass into the hand of the bellami
and two from bratham abbei and thither arthur had himself driven hi
jehu known through all the countri round as old sam wa an ancient
ostler who had been in the servic of the rewtham king head man
and boi for over fifti year and from him arthur collect a good
deal of inaccur inform about the caresfoot famili includ a
garbl version of all the death of angela mother and philip
disinherit
after all there ar few more comfort place than an inn not a
huge london hotel where you ar known as no 48 and have to lock the
door of your cell when you come out of it and deliv up your kei to
the warder in the hall but an oldfashion countri establish
where thei cook your breakfast exactli as you like it and give you
sound al and a fourpost at least so thought arthur as he sat in
the privat parlour smoke hi pipe and reflect on the curiou
vicissitud of exist now here he wa with all the hope and
interest of hi life utterli chang in a singl space of sixand
twenti hour why sixandtwenti hour ago he had never met hi
respect guardian nor sir john and ladi bellami nor philip and hi
daughter he could hardli believ that it wa onli that morn that
he had first seen angela it seem week ago and if time could have
been measur on a new principl by event and not by minut it
would have been week the wheel of life he thought revolv with a
strang irregular for month and year it turn slowli and
steadili under the even pressur of monoton event but on some
unexpect dai a tide come rush down the stream of be and
spin it round at speed and then tear onward to the ocean call the
past leav it playth to creak and turn to turn and creak or
wreck perhap and useless
think thu arthur made hi wai to bed the excit of the dai
had weari him and for a while he slept soundli but as the fatigu
of the bodi wore off the activ of hi mind assert itself and he
began to dream vagu happi dream of angela that by degre took
shape and form till thei stood out clear befor the vision of hi
mind he dreamt that he and angela were journei two such happi
travel through the green field in summer till byandbi thei
came to the dark entranc of a wood into which thei plung fear
noth thicker grew the overshadow branch and darker grew the
path and now thei journei loverwis with their arm around each
other but as thei pass along thei came to a place where the path
fork and here he stoop to kiss her alreadi he could feel the
thrill of her embrac when she wa swept from him by an unseen forc
and carri down the path befor them leav him root where he
wa but still he could trace her progress as she went wring her
hand in sorrow and present he saw the form of ladi bellami robe
as an egyptian sorceress and hold a letter in her hand which she
offer to angela whisper in her ear she took it and then in a
second the letter turn to a great snake with georg head that
threw it coil around her and struck at her with it fang next the
dark of night rush down upon the scene and out of the dark
came wild cri and mock laughter and the choke sound of death
and hi sens left him
when sight and sens came back he dreamt that he wa still walk
down a wood lane but the foliag of the overhang tree wa of a
richer green the air wa sweet with the scent of unknown flower
beauti bird flit around him and from faroff came the murmur
of the sea and as he travel brokenheart a fair woman with a
gentl voic stood by hi side and kiss and comfort him till at
length he grew weari of her kiss and she left him weep and he
went on hi wai alon seek hi lost angela and then at length the
path took a sudden turn and he stood on the shore of an illimit
ocean over which brood a strang light as where
the quiet end of even smile
mile on mile
and there with the soft light linger on her hair and tear of
glad in her ey stood angela more love than befor her arm
outstretch to greet him and then the night close in and he awok
hi ey open upon the solemn and beauti hour of the first
quicken of the dawn and the thrill and soft that come from
contact with the thing we meet in sleep wa still upon him he got up
and flung open hi lattic window from the garden beneath rose the
sweet scent of mai flower veri differ from that of hi dream
which yet linger in hi nostril whilst from a neighbour lilac
bush stream the rich melodi of the nightingal present it ceas
befor the broaden daylight but in it stead pure and clear and
cold aros the note of the mavi give tune thank and glori to
it maker and as he listen a great calm stole upon hi spirit
and kneel down there by the open window with the breath of spring
upon hi brow and the voic of the happi bird within hi ear he
prai to the almighti with all hi heart that it might pleas him in
hi wise merci to verifi hi dream inasmuch as he would be well
content to suffer if by suffer he might at last attain to such an
unutter joi and rise from hi knee feel better and
stronger he knew in some dim wai that that undertak must be blest
which in such a solemn hour of the heart he did not fear to prai god
to guid to guard and to consumm
and on mani an afterdai and in mani anoth place the book of hi
life would reopen at thi wellcon page and he would see the dim
light in the faint flush sky and hear the song of the thrush
swell upward strong and sweet and rememb hi prayer and the
peac that fell upon hi soul
by ten oclock that morn arthur hi dog and hi portmanteau had
all arriv togeth in front of the abbei hous befor hi feet had
touch the mossgrown gravel the halldoor wa flung open and
angela appear to welcom him look as old sam the ostler
forcibl put it afterward to hi helper just like a hangel with the
wing off jake too emerg from the recess of the garden and
ask angela in a tone of aggriev sarcasm as he edg hi wai
suspici past aleck why the gentleman had not brought the
rampingest lion from the zoolog garden with him at onc have
thu express hi feel on the subject of bulldog he shoulder
the portmanteau and made hi wai with it upstair arthur follow
him up the wide oak stair everi on of which wa squar out of a
singl log stop for a while on the land where the staircas
turn to gaze at the sternfac pictur that hung so that it look
through the larg window face it right across the park and over the
whole stretch of the abbei land and to wonder at the deepgrav
inscript of devil caresfoot set so conspicu beneath
hi room wa the largest upon the first land and the same in which
angela mother had di it had never been us from that hour to
thi and inde in a littl recess or open space between a cupboard
and the wall there still stood two trestl drape with rotten black
cloth that had origin been brought there to rest her coffin on
and which angela had overlook in get the room readi

histori of her innoc life and wa struck with amaz at the
varieti and depth of her scholast acquir and the extraordinari
power of her mind which combin with her simplic and total
ignor of the wai of the world produc an affect as charm as
it wa unusu needless to sai that everi hour he knew her he fell
more deepli in love with her
at length about eight oclock just as it wa begin to get dark
she suggest that he should go and sit a while with her father
and what ar you go to do ask arthur

arthur did so and present philip in that tone of gentlemanli eas
which abov everyth distinguish him from hi cousin led the
convers round to hi guest prospect and affair more
especi hi monei affair arthur answer him frankli enough but
thi monei talk had not the same charm for him that it had for hi
host inde a mark repugn to everyth that had to do with
monei wa on of hi characterist and weari out at length with
pecuniari detail and endless research into the mysteri of
invest he took advantag of a paus to attempt to chang the
subject
well he said i am much oblig to you for your advic for i am
veri ignor myself and hate anyth to do with monei i go back to
first principl and believ that we should all be better without

i alwai thought answer philip with a semicontemptu smile
that the desir of monei or amongst savag race it equival
shell or what not wa the first principl of human natur
perhap it isi realli dont know but i heartili wish that it could
be elimin off the face of the earth
forgiv me laugh philip but that is the speech of a veri young
man why elimin monei and you take awai the princip interest of

went on rise and address him with a curiou earnest what
god is there more worthi of our ador than plutu see that if
we worship him enough he alon of the idol we set in high place
will never fail us at need
it is a worship that rare bring last happi with it in our
greed to collect the mean of enjoy sure we lose the power to
enjoi
pshaw that is the cant of fool of those who do not know of those
who cannot feel but i know and i feel and i tell you that it is not
so the collect of those mean is in itself a pleasur becaus it
give a conscious of power dont talk to me of fate that
sovereign throw the coin on to the tabl is fate own seal

pariah on to be avoid and even insult good befor long these

except soliloqu arthur the cliff of the hereaft andth
grave
hi word produc a curiou effect philip eloqu broke off
short and for a moment a great fear crept into hi ey
silenc ensu which neither of them seem to care to break
meanwhil the wind suddenli sprang up and began to moan and sigh
amongst the halfclad bough of the tree outsidemak arthur
thought to himself a veri melancholi music present philip laid hi
hand upon hi guest arm and he felt that it shook like an aspen
leaf
tell me he said in a hoars whisper what do you see there
arthur start and follow the direct of hi ey to the bare
wall opposit the window at that end of the room through which the
door wa made
i see he said some move shadow
what do thei resembl
i dont know noth in particular what ar thei
what ar thei hiss philip whose face wa livid with terror
thei ar the shade of the dead sent here to tortur me look she
goe to meet him the old man is tell her now she will wring her
hand
nonsens mr caresfoot nonsens said arthur shake himself
togeth i see noth of the sort why it is onli the shadow
flung by the moonlight through the swing bough of that tree cut
it down and you will have no more write upon your wall
ah of cours you ar right heigham quit right ejacul hi
host faintli wipe the cold sweat from hi brow it is noth but
the moonlight how ridicul of me i suppos i am a littl out of
sortsliv wrong give me some whiski there a good fellow and
ill drink damnat to all the shadow and the tree that throw
them ha ha ha
there wa someth so uncanni about hi host manner and hi
evid convict of the origin of the waver figur on the wall
which had now disappear that arthur felt had it not been for
angela he would not be sorri to get clear of him and hi shadow as
soon as possibl for superstit he knew is as contagi as
smallpox when at length he reach hi great bare bedchamb not
by the wai a comfort sort of place to sleep in after such an
experi it wa onli after some hour in the excit state of hi
imagin that tire though he wa he could get the rest he
need
chapter xxiv
next morn when thei met at their eight oclock breakfast arthur
notic that angela wa distress about someth
there is bad new she said almost befor he greet her my
cousin georg is veri ill with typhu fever
inde remark arthur rather coolli
well i must sai it doe not appear to distress you veri much
no i cant sai it doe to be honest i detest your cousin and i
dont care if he is ill or not there
as she appear to have no repli readi the subject then drop
after breakfast angela propos that thei should walkfor the dai wa
again fineto the top of a hill about a mile awai whenc a view of
the surround countri could be obtain he consent and on the
wai told her of hi curiou experi with her father on the
previou night she listen attent and when he had finish
shook her head
there is she said someth about my father that separ him
from everybodi els hi life never come out into the sunlight of the
pass dai it alwai grope along in the shadow of some gloomi past
what the mysteri is that envelop him i neither know nor care to
inquir but i am sure that there is on
how do you explain the shadow
i believ your explan is right thei ar under certain
condit of light thrown by a tree that grow some distanc off i
have seen someth that look like figur on that wall myself in
full daylight that he should interpret such a simpl thing as he doe
show a curiou state of mind
you do not think then said arthur in order to draw her out that
it is possibl after all he wa right and that thei were someth
from anoth place the realiti of hi terror wa almost enough to
make on believ in them i can tell you
no i do not answer angela after a minut thought i have no
doubt that the veil between ourselv and the unseen world is thinner
than we think i believ too that commun and even warn
sometim under favour condit or when the veil is worn thin
by troubl or prayer can pass from the other world to ourselv but
the veri fact of my father terror prove to me that hi shadow ar
noth of the sort for it is hardli possibl that spirit can be
permit to come to terrifi us poor mortal if thei come at all it
is in love and gentl to comfort or to warn and not to work upon
our superstit
you speak as though you knew all about it you should join the new
ghost societi he answer irrever sit himself down on a
fallen tree an exampl that she follow
i have thought about it sometim that is all and so far as i have
read i think that my belief is a common on and what the bibl
teach us but if you will not think me foolish i will tell you
someth that confirm me in it you know that my mother di when i
wa born well it mai seem strang to you but i am convinc that
she is sometim veri near me
do you mean that you see or hear her
no i onli feel her presenc more rare now i am sorri to sai as
i grow older
how do you mean
i can hardli explain what i mean but sometimesit mai be at night
or when i am sit alon in the daytimea great calm come upon me
and i am a chang woman all my thought rise into a higher purer
air and ar as it were ting with a reflect light everyth
earthli seem to pass awai from me and i feel as though fetter had
fallen from my soul and i know that i am near my mother then
everyth pass and i am left myself again
and what ar the thought you have at these time
ah i wish i could tell you thei pass awai with her who brought
them leav noth but a vagu afterglow in my mind like that in
the sky after the sun ha set but now look at the view is it not
beauti in the sunlight all the world seem to be rejoic
angela wa right the view wa charm below lai the thatch roof
of the littl villag of bratham and to the right the water of the
lake shone like silver in the glanc sunlight whilst the gabl of
the old hous peep out from amongst the bud foliag look
veri picturesqu the spring had cast her green garment over the land
from everi cops rang out the melodi of bird and the gentl breez
wa heavi with the scent of the unnumb violet that star the
mossi carpet at their feet in the field where grew the wheat and
clover now spring into lusti life the busi weeder were at work
and on the warm brown fallow the sower went forth to sow from the
earli pastur beneath where purl a littl brook there came a
pleasant low of kine wellcont with the new grass and a
cheer bleat of lamb to whom as yet life wa noth but on
long skip it wa a charm scene and it influenc sank deep into
the gazer heart
it is depress to think said arthur rather sententi but
realli chiefli with the object of get at hi companion view
that all thi cannot last but is as it were like ourselv under
sentenc of death
it rose and fell and fleet
upon earth troubl sea
a wave that swell to vanish
into etern
oh mysteri and wonder
of wing that cannot fly
of ear that cannot hearken
of life that livesto die
quoth angela by wai of comment
whose line ar those ask arthur i dont know them
my own she said shyli that is thei ar a translat of a vers
of a greek od i wrote for mr fraser i will sai you the origin if
you like i think it better than the translat and i believ that
it is fair greek
thank you thank you miss bluestock i am quit satisfi with
your english version you posit alarm me angela most peopl ar
quit content if thei can put a poem written in english into greek
you revers the process and have coolli given express to your
thought in greek condescend to translat them into your nativ
tongu i onli wish you had been at cambridg orwhat do thei call
the placegirton it would have been a joke to see you come out
doublefirst
ah she broke in blush you ar like mr fraser you overr
my acquir i am sorri to sai i am not the perfect scholar you
think me and about most thing i am shockingli ignor i should
inde be silli if after ten year patient work under such a scholar
as mr fraser i did not know some classic and mathemat why do
you know for the last three year that we work togeth we us as
a rule to carri on our ordinari convers dure work in latin and
greek month and month about sometim with the funniest result on
never know how littl on doe know of a dead languag till on tri
to talk it just try to speak in latin for the next five minut and
you will see
thank you i am not go to expos my ignor for your amus
angela
she laugh
no she said it is you who wish to amus yourself at my expens by
try to make me believ that i am a great scholar but what i wa
go to sai befor you attack me about my fanci acquir
wa that in my opinion your remark about the whole world be under
sentenc of death wa rather a morbid on
why it is obvious true
ye in a sens but to my mind thi scene speak more of
resurrect than of death look at the earth push up her flower
and the dead tree break into beauti there is no sign of death
there but rather of a renew and glorifi life
ye but there is still the aw fact of death to face natur
herself ha been temporarili dead befor she bloom into beauti she
di everi autumn to rise again in the same form everi spring but
how do we know in what form we shall emerg from the chrysali as
soon as a man begin to think at all he stand face to face with thi
hideou problem to the solut of which he know himself to be
draw daili nearer hi posit i often think is wors than that
of a crimin under sentenc becaus the crimin is onli be
depriv of the employ of a term indefinit inde but
absolut limit but man at larg doe not know of what he is
depriv and what he must inherit in the aeon that await him it is
the uncertainti of death that is it most dread part and with
that hang over our race the wonder to me is not onli that we for
the most part put the subject entir out of mind but that we can
ever think serious of anyth els
i rememb answer angela onc think veri much in the same
wai and i went to mr fraser for advic the bibl he said will
satisfi your doubt and fear if onli you will read it in a right
spirit and inde more or less it did i cannot of cours
ventur to advis you but i pass hi advic on it is that of a veri
good man
have you then no dread of death or rather of what li beyond
it
she turn her ey upon him with someth of wonder in them
and why she said should i who am immort fear a chang that i
know ha no power to harm me that can on the contrari onli bring me
nearer to the purpos of my be certainli i shrink from death
itself as we all must but of the danger beyond i have no fear
pleasant as thi world is at time there is someth in us all that
strive to rise abov it and if i knew that i must die within thi
hour i believ that i could meet my fate without a qualm i am sure
that when our trembl hand have drawn the veil from death we shall
find hi featur passionless inde but veri beauti
arthur look at her with astonish wonder what manner of woman
thi could be who in the first flush of youth and beauti could face
the great unknown without a tremor when he spoke again it wa with
someth of enviou bitter
ah it is veri well for you whose life ha been so pure and free
from evil but it is differ for me with all my conscious of
sin and imperfect for me and thousand like me strive as we
will immort ha terror as well as hope it is and alwai will
be human to fear the futur for human natur never chang you know
the line in hamlet it is
that the dread of someth after death
the undiscov countri from whose bourn
no travel returnspuzzl the will
and make us rather bear those ill we have
than fly to other that we know not of
thu conscienc doe make coward of us all
thei ar true and while men last thei alwai will be true
oh arthur she answer earnestli and for the first time
address him in convers by hi christian name how limit
your trust must be in the merci of a creator whose merci is as wide
as the ocean that you can talk like that you speak of me too as
better than yourselfhow am i better i have my bad thought and do
bad thing as much as you and though thei mai not be the same i am
sure thei ar quit as black as your sinc everybodi must be
respons accord to their charact and temptat i try
howev to trust in god to cover my sin and believ that if i do
my best he will forgiv me that is all but i have no busi to
preach to you who ar older and wiser than i am
if he broke in lai hi hand involuntarili upon her own you
knewalthough i have never spoken of them to ani on befor and
could not speak of them to anybodi but yourselfhow these thing
weigh upon my mind you would not sai that but would try to teach me
your faith
how can i teach you arthur when i have so much to learn myself
she answer simpli and from that moment though she did not know it
as yet she love him
thi conversationa veri curiou on arthur thought to himself
afterward for two young peopl on a spring morninghav come to
an end noth more wa said for some while and thei took their wai
down the hill vari the rout in order to pass through the littl
hamlet of bratham under a chestnuttre that stood upon the villag
green arthur notic not a villag blacksmith but a small crowd
mostli compos of children gather round somebodi on go to see
who it wa he discov a batteredlook old man with an
intellectu face and the remnant of a gentlemanlik appear
plai on the violin a veri few touch of hi bow told arthur who
knew someth of music that he wa in the presenc of a perform of
no mean merit see the qualiti of hi two auditor and that thei
appreci hi perform the player chang hi music and from a
villag jig pass to on of the more difficult opera air which he
execut in brilliant fashion
bravo cri arthur as the last note thrill and di awai i
see you understand how to plai the fiddl
ye sir and so i should for i have plai first violin at her
majesti opera befor now name what you like and i will plai it

brook the wind pass through the tree or the wave fall on the
beach onli sai the word
arthur thought for a moment
it is a beauti dai let us have a contrastg us the music of a
storm
the old man consid a while

chapter xxv
on the follow dai the somewhat curiou religi convers
between arthur and angelaa convers which begun on arthur
part out of curios had end on both side veri much in earnest
the weather broke up and the grand old english climat reassert it
treacher supremaci from summer weather the inhabit of the
counti of marlshir suddenli found themselv plung into a spell of
cold that wa by contrast almost arctic storm of sleet drove against
the windowpan and there wa even a veri damag nightfrost
while that dread scourg which nobodi in hi sens except
kingslei can ever have like the east wind liter pervad the
whole place and went whistl through the surround tree and
ruin in a wai calcul to make even a lapland shiver
under these cheerless circumst our pair of companionsfor as yet
thei were ostens at ani rate noth moregav up their outdoor
excurs and took to rambl over the disus room in the old
hous and hunt up mani a record some of them valuabl and curiou
enough of longforgotten caresfoot and even of the old prior
befor them a splendidli illumin missal be amongst the latter
prize when thi amus wa exhaust thei sat togeth over the
fire in the nurseri and angela translat to him from her favourit
classic author especi homer with an eas and fluenci of
express that to arthur wa littl short of miracul or when
thei got tire of that he read to her from standard writer which
elabor as her educ had been in certain respect she had
scarc yet even open notabl shakespear and milton needless to
sai herself imbu with a strong poetic feel these immort
writer were a sourc of intens delight to her
how is it that mr fraser never gave you shakespear to read ask
arthur on dai as he shut up the volum have come to the end of
hamlet
he said that i should be better abl to appreci it when my mind
had been prepar to do so by the help of a classic and mathemat
educ and that it would be a mistak to cloi my mental palat
with sweet befor i had learnt to appreci their flavour
there is some sens in that remark arthur by the wai how ar
the vers you promis to write me get on have you done them
yet
i have done someth she answer modestli but i realli do not
think that thei ar worth produc it is veri tiresom of you to
have rememb about them
arthur howev by thi time knew enough of angela abil to be
sure that her someth would be someth more or less worth
hear and mildli insist on their product and then to her
confus on her read them aloud thei ran as follow and
whatev angela opinion of them mai have been the reader shall
judg of them for himself
a storm on the string
the minstrel sat in hi lone room
it wall were bare and the twilight grei
fell and crept and gather to gloom
it came like the ghost of the dy dai
and the chord fell hush and low
pianissimo
hi arm wa rais and the violin
quiver and shook with the strain it bore
while the swell forth of the sound within
rose with a sweet unknown befor
and the chord fell soft and low
piano
the first cold flap of the tempest wing
clash with the silenc befor the storm
the raindrop patter across the string
as the gather thundercloud took form
drip drop high and low
staccato
heavili roll the thunder roar
sudden and jag the lightn plai
faster and faster the raindrop pour
sob and surg the treecrest swai
crack and crash abov below
crescendo
the wind tore howl across the wold
and tangl hi train in the groan tree
wrap the dens cloud in hi mantl cold
then shiver and di in a wail breez
whistl and weep high and low
sostenuto
a pale sun broke from the drive cloud
and flash in the raindrop seren cool
at the touch of hi finger the forest bow
as it shimmer and glanc in the ruffl pool
while the rustl leav sough soft and low
gracioso
it wa onli a dream on the throb string
an echo of natur in phantasi wrought
a breath of her breath and a touch of her wing
from a kingdom outspread in the region of thought
below roll the sound of the citi din
and the fade dai as the night drew in
show the quaint old face and the point chin
and the arm that wa rais oer the violin
as the old man whisper hi hope dead tale
to the friend who could comfort though other might fail
and the chord stole hush and low
pianissimo
he stop and the sheet of paper fell from hi hand
well she said with all the eager of a newborn writer tell
me do you think them veri bad
well angela you know
ah go on now i am readi to be crush prai dont spare my
feel
i wa about to sai that thank be to provid i am not a critic
but i think
oh ye let me hear what you think you ar speak so slowli in
order to get time to invent someth extra cut well i deserv
it
dont interrupt i wa go to sai that i think the piec abov the
averag of secondclass poetri and that a few of the line touch the
firstclass standard you have caught someth of the divin
afflatu that the drunken old fellow said he could not cage but i do
not think that you will ever be popular as a writer of vers if you
keep to that style i doubt if there is a magazin in the kingdom that
would take those line unless thei were by a known writer thei would
return them mark good but too vagu for the gener public
magazin editor dont like line from a kingdom outspread in the
region of thought for as thei sai such poem ar apt to excit
vagu in the brain of that dim entiti the gener public what
thei do like ar commonplac idea put in pretti languag and
sweeten with sentiment or emot religi feel such as
the think power of their subscrib ar compet to absorb
without mental strain and without leav their accustom channel
to be popular it is necessari to be commonplac or at the least to
describ the commonplac to work in a wellworn groov and not to
startlerequir which unfortun simpl as thei seem veri
few person possess the art of act up to see what happen to the
unfortun novelist for instanc who dare to break the unwritten
law and defraud hi reader of the orthodox transform scene of
the reward of virtu and the discomfitur of vice or to make hi
creation finish up in a wai that howev well it mai be suit to it
tenor or illustr it more subtl mean is contrari to the
gener reader idea as to how it should endbadli as it is
call he simpli collaps to rise no more if he is new at the
trade and if he is a known man that book wont sell
you talk quit feelingli said angela who wa get rather bore
and want not unnatur to hear more about her own line
ye repli arthur grimli i do onc i wa fool enough to write
a book but i must tell you that it is a pain subject with me it
never came out nobodi would have it
oh arthur i am so sorri i should like to read your book but as
regard the vers i am glad that you like them and i realli dont
care what a hypothet gener public would sai i wrote them to
pleas you not the gener public
well my dear i am sure i am much oblig to you i shall valu them
doubli onc for the giver sake and onc for their own
angela blush but did not reprov the term of endear which had
slip unawar from hi lip poetri is a danger subject between
two young peopl who at heart ador on anoth it is apt to excit
the brain and bring about startl revel
the dai follow the read of angela piec of poetri wa render
remark by two event of which the first wa that the weather
suddenli turn a somersault and becam beautifulli warm and the
second that new reach the abbei hous that thank chiefli to ladi
bellami devot nursingwho fearless of infect had to the
great admir of all her neighbour volunt her servic when
no nurs could be found to undertak the casegeorg wa pronounc
out of danger thi piec of new wa peculiarli grate to philip
for had hi cousin di the estat must have pass awai for ever
under the term of hi uncl will for he knew that georg had made
none angela too tri like a good girl as she wa to lash herself
into enthusiasm about it though in her heart she went as near hate
her cousin sinc hi attempt indign toward herself as her
gentl natur would allow arthur alon wa cynic indiffer he
hate georg without ani reserv whatsoev
and after thi their came for our pair of embryo lover some ten or
twelv such happi dai for there wa no talk of arthur departur
philip have on sever occas pointedli told him that the hous
wa at hi dispos for as long as he chose to remain in it the sky
wa blue in those dai or onli fleck with summer cloud just as
arthur and angela perfect companionship wa fleck and shade with
the deeper hue of dawn passion ala the sky in thi terrestri
clime is never quit blue
but as yet noth of love had pass between them no kiss or word of
endear onli when hand touch hand a strang thrill had move
them both and sent the warm blood to stain angela clear brow like
a waver tint of sunlight thrown upon the marbl featur of some
white venu onli in each other ey thei found a holi mysteri the
spell wa not yet fulli at work but the wand of earth great
enchant had touch them and thei were chang angela is hardli
the same girl she wa when we met her a littl more than a fortnight
back a nameless chang ha come over her face and manner the merri
smile onc so bright ha grown softer and more sweet and the
laugh light of her grei ey ha given place to a look of some such
gratitud and wonder as that with which the travel in lone
desert gaze on the oasi of hi perfect rest
mani time arthur had almost blurt out the truth to the woman he
passion ador and everi dai so ad to the suppress fire of
hi love that at length he felt that he could not keep hi secret to
himself much longer and yet he fear to tell it better he thought
to live happi if in doubt than to risk all hi fortun on a singl
throw for befor hi ey there lai the black dread of failur and
then what would life be worth here with angela he live in a garden
of eden that no forebod no anxieti no fear of that partial
scotch serpent georg could render wretch so long as it wa
gladden by the presenc of her whom he hope to make hi ev but
without and around where she could not be there wa noth but
clod and thistl and a black desol that even in imagin
he dare not face
and angela gaze on veil mysteri with wonder ey wa she
happi dure those springtid dai almost but still there wa in
her heart a conscious of effort a sens of transform and
knowledg of the growth of hidden thing the bud burst into the
glori of the rose must if there be feel in a rose undergo some
such effort befor it can make it beauti known the butterfli but
newli freed from the dull husk that hid it splendour at first must
feel the imperfect wing it stretch in the sun to be irksom to it
unaccustom sens and so it wa with angela she spread her half
grown wing in the sun of her new exist and found them strang
not know as yet that thei were shape to bear her to the flower
crown height of love
her wa on of those rare natur in which the passion that we know
by the gener term of love approach as near perfect as is
possibl in our human heart for there ar mani sort and divis
of love rang from the affect pure steadi and divin that is
shower upon us from abov to the degrad mad of such a on as
georg caresfoot it is sure on of the saddest evid of our
poor human that even among the purest of us there ar none who
can altogeth rid the white of the love thei have to offer of it
earthli stain inde if we could so far conquer the prompt of
our natur as to love with perfect puriti we should becom like
angel but just as white flower ar sometim to be found on the
blackest peak so there do bloom in the world spirit as pure as thei
ar rareso free from evil so close shadow by the almighti wing
that thei can almost reach to thi perfect then the love thei have
to give is too refin too holi and strong to be understood of the
mass of men often it is squander on some unequ and unansw
natur sometim it is wise offer up to him from whom it came
we gaze upon an icebound river and there is noth to tell us that
beneath that white cloak it current rush to the ocean but
present the spring come the prison water burst their fetter
and we see a glad torrent sparkl in the sunlight and so it wa
with our heroin heart the breath of arthur passion and the light
of arthur ey had beat upon it and almost freed the river of it
love alreadi the listen might hear the icesheet crack and start
soon thei will be gone and her deep devot will set as strong
toward him as the tide of the torrent toward it receiv sea
fine write perhap the reader will sai but sure none too fine
to describ the most beauti thing in thi strang world the
irrevoc gift of a good woman love
howev that mai be it will have serv it purpos if it make it
clear that a crisi is at hand in the affair of the heart of two of
the central actor on thi mimic stage
chapter xxvi
on saturdai morn when mai wa threepart gone philip announc
hi intent of go up to london till the mondai on busi he
wa a man who had long sinc becom callou to appear and though
arthur fear lest spite thing should be said of angela almost
hint that it would look odd hi host mere laugh and said that
he had littl doubt but that hi daughter wa quit abl to look after
herself even when such a fascin young gentleman as himself wa
concern as a matter of fact hi object wa to get rid of angela by
marri her to thi young heigham who had so opportun tumbl
down from the ski and whom he rather like than otherwis thi
be the case he rightli conclud that the more the two were left
togeth the greater probabl there wa of hi object be
attain accordingli he left them togeth as much as possibl
it wa on the even of thi saturdai that arthur gather up hi
courag and ask angela to come and walk through the ruin with him
angela hesit a littl the shadow of someth about to happen had
fallen on her mind but the extraordinari beauti of the even to
sai noth of the prospect of hi compani turn the scale in
arthur favour
it wa on of those night of which if we ar lucki we get some five
or six in the cours of an english summer the moon wa at her full
and the twilight end she fill the heaven with her light everi
twig and blade of grass show out as clearli as in the dai but
look like frost silver the silenc wa intens and so still wa
the air that the sharp shadow of the tree were motionless upon the
grass onli grow with the grow hour it wa on of those night
that fill us with an indescrib emot bring us into closer
companionship with the unseen than ever doe the garish busi dai in
such an hour we can sometim feel or think that we can feel other
presenc around us and involuntarili we listen for the whisper of
the wing and the halfforgotten voic of our belov
on thi particular even some such feel wa stir in angela
heart as with slow step she led the wai into the littl villag
churchyard a similar spot to that which is to be found in mani a
countri parish except that the popul be veri small there
were but few recent grave most of the mound had no headston to
recal the name of the neglect dead but here and there were dot
discolour slab some sunk a foot or two into the soil a few ly
prone upon it and the remaind thrown by the gradual subsid of
their support into everi varieti of angl as though thei had been
suddenli halt in the maddest whirl of a grotesqu danc of death
pick her wai through these angela stop under an ancient yew
and point to on of the two shadow mount to which the moonlight
scarc struggl said in a low voic
that is my mother grave
it wa a modest tenement enough a littl heap of close green turf
surround by a rail and plant with sweetwilliam and forget
menot at it head wa place a white marbl cross on which arthur
could just distinguish the word hilda caresfoot and the date of
death
he wa about to speak but she stop him with a gentl movement and
then step forward to the head of the rail she buri her face
in her hand and remain motionless arthur watch her with
curios what he wonder wa pass in the mind of thi strang
and beauti woman who had grown up so sweet and pure amidst moral
desol like a white lili bloom alon on the black african
plain in winter suddenli she rais her head and saw the inquir
look he bent upon her she came toward him and in that sweet half
plead voic which wa on of her greatest charm she said
i fear you think me veri foolish
why should i think you foolish
becaus i have come here at night to stand befor a halfforgotten
grave
i do not think you foolish inde i wa onli wonder what wa
pass in your mind
angela hung her head and made no answer and the clock abov them
boom out the hour rais it sullen note in insol defianc of
the silenc what is it that is so solemn about the strike of the
belfryclock when on stand in a churchyard at night is it that the
hour soften our natur and make them more amen to semi
superstiti influenc or is it that the thousand evid of
depart mortal which surround us appeal with dumb forc to
natur fear throw open for a space the gate of our worldseal
imagin to tenant it vast hall with prophet echo of our
end perhap it is useless to inquir the result remain the same
few of us can hear those tone at night without a qualm and did we
put our thought into word thei would run someth thu
that sound onc broke upon the live ear of those who sleep around
us we hear it now in a littl while hour after hour it will echo
against the tombston of our grave and new gener come
out of the silent futur will stand where we stand and hearken and
muse as we muse over the old problem that we have gone to solv
whilst weshal we not be deaf to hear and dumb to utter
such at ani rate were the unspoken thought that crept into the
heart of arthur and angela as the full sound from the belfri thin
itself awai into silenc she grew a littl pale and glanc at him
and he gave an involuntari shiver while even the dog aleck snif
and whine uncomfort
it feel cold he said shall we go
thei turn and walk toward the gate and by the time thei reach
it all superstiti thought had vanishedat ani rate from
arthur mind for he recollect that he had set himself a task to
do and that now would be the time to do it absorb in thi
reflect he forgot hi polit and pass first through the
turnstil on the further side he paus and look earnestli into
hi belov face their ey met and there wa that in hi that
caus her to swiftli drop her own a silenc ensu as thei stood by
the gate he broke it
it is a love night let us walk through the ruin
i shall wet my feet the dew must be fall
there is no dew fall tonight wont you come
let us go tomorrow it is later than i gener go in pigott will
wonder what ha becom of me
never mind pigott the night is too fine to wast asleep besid
you know on should alwai look at ruin by moonlight pleas come
she look at him doubtfulli hesit and came
what do you want to see she said present with as near an
approach to irrit as he had ever heard her indulg in that is
the famou window that mr fraser alwai goe into raptur about
it is beauti shall we sit down here and look at it
thei sat down on a low mass of fallen masonri some fifteen pace from
the window around them lai a delic traceri of shadow whilst thei
themselv were seat in the ey of the moonlight and remain for a
while as silent and as still as though thei had been the shade of the
paint figur that had onc fill the stoni frame abov them
angela he said at lengthangela listen and i will tell you
someth my mother a woman to whom sorrow had becom almost an
inspir when she wa dy spoke to me someth thu there

still there wa silenc but he thought that he saw her breast heav
gentli then he place hi hand all trembl with the fierc emot
that throb along hi vein upon the palm that hung listless by her
side and gaze into her ey still she neither spoke nor shrank
and in the imperfect light her face look veri pale while her

then slowli he gather up hi courag for an effort and rais hi
face to the level of her own he kiss her full upon her lip she
stir she sigh he had broken the spell the sweet face that had
withdrawn itself drew nearer to him for a second the awaken ey

passion if onli on could discov it why do you want these
particular land your monei will bui other just as good
why doe a swiss get homesick why doe a man defraud of hi own

with her and wild to marri her
well
well dont you now see a wai to forc your cousin to sell the
land
at the price of angela hand
precis
philip walk up and down the room in thought though as the reader
mai rememb he had himself but a month befor been base enough to
suggest that hi daughter should us her ey to forward hi project
he had never in justic to him be it said dreamt of forc her into
a marriag in everi wai littl less than unnatur hi idea of
respons toward hi daughter wa as regard sin of omiss
extrem lax but there were some of commiss that he did not care
to face certain fear and memori oppress him too much to allow of
it
ladi bellami he said present you have known my cousin georg
intim for mani year and ar probabl suffici acquaint
with hi habit of life to know that such a marriag would be an
infami
mani a man who ha been wild in hi youth make a good husband she
answer quietli
the more i think of it went on philip excitedli after the fashion
of on who would lash himself into a passion the more i see the
utter imposs of ani such thing and i must sai that i wonder at
your have undertaken such an errand on the on hand there is a
young girl who though i do not from forc of circumst see much
of myself is i believ as good as she is handsom
and on the other broke in ladi bellami iron ar the
isleworth estat
and on the other went on philip without pai heed to her remark
i am go to speak plainli ladi bellamyi a man utterli devoid
of the foundat of moral charact whose appear is certainli
against him who i have got reason to know is not to be trust and
who is old enough to be her father and her cousin to bootand you
ask me to forward such a marriag as thi i will have noth to do
with it my respons as a father forbid it it would be the
wickedest thing i have ever done to put the girl into the power of
such a man
ladi bellami burst into a low peal of laughter she never laugh
aloud she thought that it wa now time to throw him a littl off hi
balanc
forgiv me she said with her sweetest smile but you must admit
that there is someth rather ludicr in hear the hero of the
great maria lee scandal talk about moral charact and the father
who detest hi daughter so much that he fear to look her in the
face and whose sole object is to rid himself of an encumbr
prate of hi patern respons
philip start visibl at her word
ah mr caresfoot she went on i surpris you by my knowledg but
we women ar sad spi and it is my littl amus to find out
other peopl secret a veri us littl amus i could tell
you mani thing
i wa about to sai broke in philip who had natur no desir to
see more of the secret of hi life unveil by ladi bellami that
even if i did wish to get rid of angela i should have littl
difficulti in do so as young heigham who ha been stop at the
abbei hous for a fortnight or so is head over ear in love with her
inde i should think it highli probabl that thei ar at thi moment
engag
it wa ladi bellami turn to start now
ah she said i did not know that that complic matter and
then with a sudden chang of tonemr caresfoot as a friend let
me beg of you not to throw awai such a chanc in a hurri for the sake
of a few nonsens idea abut a girl what is she after all that
she should stand in the wai of such grave interest as you have in

own term and fix your own price

everybodi especi your daughter georg will get what he want
you with the recoveri of the estat will also recov your lost

chapter xxviii
with what degre of sound our pair of lover slumber on that
memor saturdai night let those who have been so fortun or
unfortun as to have been place in analog circumst form
their own opinion
it is howev certain that arthur gaze upon the moon and sundri of
the larger planet for some hour until thei unkindli set and left
him for hi candl had burnt out to find hi wai to bed in the dark
with hi reflect we will not troubl ourselv or rather we
will not intrud upon their privaci but there wa anoth person in
the hous who sat at an open window and look upon the heaven
angela to wit let us avail ourselv of our right privileg and
look into her thought
arthur love had come upon her as a surpris but it had found a
perfect home all the dai and hour that she had spent in hi
compani had unknown to herself been mysteri emploi in
prepar a habit to receiv it we all know the beauti bibl
stori of the creation how first there wa an empti void and the
spirit brood on the water then light and then life and last
man come to turn all thing to hi us sure that stori which is
the type and symbol of mani thing is of none more so than of the
growth and birth of a perfect love in the human heart
the soil is made readi in the dead winter and receiv the seed into
it bosom then come the spring and it is cloth with verdur
space is void till the sun shoot it sudden rai athwart it and
make it splendid the heart is cold and unwit of it end till
the spirit brood upon it as upon the water and it grow quick with
the purpos of life and then what a chang is there what ha the
flower in common with the seed from whenc it sprang or the noondai
sky with the dark befor the dawn
think in her chamber with the night air plai on her hot brow
and her hand press upon her heart as though to still the tumult of
it joi angela grew vagu consciou of these thing
wa she the same in heart and mind that she had been a month ago no
a thousand time no then what wa thi mysteri chang that seem
to shake her inmost life to it foundat what angel had troubl
the water into which she had so newli plung and whenc came the
heal virtu that she found in them bring rest after the vagu
troubl of the last two week with sight to see the onli goodher
love with speed to follow and strength to hold oh happi happi
world oh merci creator who gave her to drink of such a live
spring oh arthur belov arthur
on sundai morn it wa pigott habit to relax the draconian
sever of her law in the matter of breakfast which gener
speak wa not till about halfpast eight oclock at that hour
precis on the sabbath in question she appear as usualno not
as usual for it be sundai she had on her stiff black gownand
with all due solemn made the tea
a few minut elaps and angela enter dress in white and veri
love in her simpl tightfit robe but a trifl pale and with
a shy look upon her face
she greet her nurs with a kiss
why what is the matter with you deari ejacul pigott whose
watch ey detect a chang she could not defin you look
differ somehow
hush i will tell you byandbi
at that moment arthur quick step wa heard advanc down the
passag togeth with a patter nois that announc the presenc
of aleck and as thei came angela poor angela grew red and redder
and yet more painfulli red till pigott watch her face wa
enabl to form a shrewd guess as to what wa the caus of her
unaccustom look
on came the step and open flew the door more and more readi to sink
into the earth look angela and so interest grew nurs pigott
that she actual pour some hot tea on to her dress a thing she
could never rememb have done befor
the first to enter wa aleck who follow hi custom sprang upon
angela and lick her hand and behind aleck look somewhat
confus but handsom and happyfor hi wa on of those face that
becom handsom when their owner ar happycam aleck master and
then there ensu an infinitesim but most awkward paus
on such occas as the present name the first meet after an
engag there is alwaysespeci when it occur in the presenc
of a third persona veri consider difficulti in the mind of the
parti to know what demeanour thei ar to adopt toward on anoth
ar thei to treat the littl affair of the previou even as a kind
of confidenti commun not to be allud to except in privat
convers and to drop into the mr and miss of yesterdai that
would certainli be the easiest but then it would also be a decid
act of mutual retreat or ar thei to rush into each other arm as
becom betroth lover thi process is so new that thei feel that
it still requir privat rehears and meanwhil time press and
everybodi is begin to stare and someth must be done
these were veri much the feel of arthur and angela he hesit
befor her confus and she kept her head down over the dog but
present aleck get bore move on and as it would have been
inan to continu to stare at the floor she had to rais herself as
slowli as she might soon their ey arriv in the same plane and
whether a mutual glanc of intellig wa exchang or whether
their power of attract overcam hi power of resist it is not
easi to determin but certain it is that follow a primari natur
law arthur gravit toward her and kiss her on the face
my exclaim pigott and the milkjug roll unheed on the floor
hum i suppos i had better explain began he
i think you have spilt the milk ad she
that we have becom engag and ar
all to piec i declar broke in angela with her head somewher
near the carpet
and then thei both laugh
well i never no not in all my born dai sir and miss angela all
i have got to sai about thi extraordinari proceedingthei glanc
at each other in alarmi that i am veri glad to hear on it and i
hope and prai how as you mai be happi and if you treat my angela
right youll be just the happiest and luckiest man in the three
kingdom includ ireland the royal famili and if you treat her
wrong wors will come to you and her poor mother last word as i
heard with my own ear will come true to you and serv you right
and there all the milk upon the floor and god bless you both my
dear is the prayer of an old woman
and here the worthi soul broke down and began to cry nor were
angela ey free from tear
after thi littl episod breakfast proceed in someth like the
usual wai church wa at 1030 and a while befor the hour arthur
and angela stroll down to the spot that had alreadi becom as holi
ground to them and look into each other ey and said again the
same sweet word then thei went on and mingl with the littl
congregationthat did not number more than thirti soulsthei pass
into the cool quiet of the church
lawk said a woman as thei went by aint she just a beauti what
a pretti wed theyd make
arthur overheard it and note the woman and afterward found a
pretext to give her five shill becaus he said it wa a lucki
omen
on the communiont of the pretti littl church there wa spread
the fair white cloth of the rubric it wa the dai for the monthli
celebr of the sacrament that met the religi requir of
the villag
will you stai to the sacrament with me whisper angela to her
lover in the interv between their seat themselv and the entri
of the clergyman mr fraser locum tenen
arthur nod assent
and so when the time came those two went up togeth to the altar
rail and kneel side by side at of the bread and drank of the
cup and rise depart thenc with a new link between them for
be sure part of the prayer which thei offer up at that high moment
were in humbl petit to the almighti to set hi solemn seal and
bless on their love inde so far as angela wa concern there
were few act of her simpl life that she did not consecr by
prayer how much more then wa she bent on bring thi the
greatest of all her act befor her maker throne
strang inde and full of a holi promis is the yearn with which
we turn to heaven to seek sanctif of our deed feel our
weak and crave strength from the sourc of strength a yearn
of which the church with that subtl knowledg of human natur which
is on of the mainspr of it power ha not been slow to avail
itself and thi need is more especi felt in matter connect
with the noblest of all passion perhap becaus all true love and
all true religion come from a common home
thu pledg to on anoth with a new and aw pledg and knit
togeth in the bond of an univers love embrac their poor
affect as the wide ski embrac the earth thei rose and went
their wai purer to worship and stronger to endur
that afternoon arthur had a convers with hi betroth that
partak of a busi natur in the begin end rather oddli
i must speak to your father when he come back tomorrow dear he
began
my father oh ye i had forgotten about that and she look a
littl anxiou

myself you know that he is not veri fond of me
that is strang want of tast on hi part
oh i dont know everybodi doe not see me with your ey arthur
becaus thei have not the chanc all the world would love you if it
knew you but serious i think that he can hardli object or he
would not have allow us to be thrown so much togeth for in nine
case out of ten that sort of thing ha onli on result
what do you mean
i mean that to import a young fellow into the hous and throw him
sole into a daughter compani is veri apt to bring aboutwel
what ha been brought about
then you mean that you think that i should have fallen in love with
ani gentleman who had come here
arthur not see the slight flash of indign in her ey
repli
well you know there is alwai a risk but i should imagin that it
would veri much depend upon the gentleman
arthurwith a littl stampi am asham of you how can you think
such thing of me you must have a veri poor opinion of me
my dear why should i suppos myself superior to anybodi els that
you should onli fall in love with me you set too high a valu on me
and you set too low a valu on me you do not understand me you ar
my fate my other self how would it have been possibl for me to love
ani on but you i feel as though i had been travel to meet you
sinc the begin of the world to stand by your side till it
crumbl awai ye for etern itself oh arthur do not laugh at
what i sai i am inde onli a simpl girl but as i told you last
night there is someth stir in me now my real life my etern

she wa inspir and the same feel of aw that had come upon him
when he first saw her face again took possess of him take her
hand he kiss it
dearest he said dearest angela who am i that you should love me
so what have i done that such a treasur should be given to me i
hope that it mai be as you sai
it will be as i sai she answer as she bent to kiss him and thei
went on in silenc
chapter xxix
philip arriv home about on oclock on the mondai and after their
nurseri dinner arthur made hi wai to the studi and soon found
himself in the dread presencefor what presenc is more dread most
peopl would rather face a chiefjustic with the goutof the man
whose daughter he wa about to ask in marriag
philip whom he found seat by a trai the content of which he
seem in no humour to touch receiv him with hi customari
polit sai with a smile that he hope he had not come to
tell him that he wa sick of the place and it inhabit and wa
go awai
far from it mr caresfoot i come to speak to you on a veri
differ subject
philip glanc up with a quick look of expect curios but said
noth
in short said arthur desper i come to ask you to sanction
my engag to angela
a pausea veri awkward pauseensu
you ar then engag to my daughter
subject to your consent i am
then came anoth paus
you will understand me heigham when i sai that you take me rather
by surpris in thi busi your acquaint with her ha been
short
that is true but i have seen a great deal of her
perhap but she know absolut noth of the world and her
prefer for youfor as you sai you ar engag to her i presum
she ha shown a preferencemai be a mistak mere a young girl
romant idea
arthur thought of hi convers of the previou dai with angela
and could not help smile as he answer
i think if you ask her that she will tell you that is not the case
heigham i will be frank with you i like you and you have i
believ suffici mean of cours you know that my daughter will
have nothingat ani rate till i am dead he ad quickli
i never thought about the matter but i shall be onli too glad to
marri her with noth but herself
veri good i wa go to sai that notwithstand thi marriag is
an import matter and i must have time to think over it befor i
give you a decid answer sai a week i shall not howev expect
you to leav here unless you wish to do so nor shall i seek to place
ani restrict on your intercours with angela sinc it would
appear that the mischief is alreadi done i am flatter by your
propos but i must have time and you must understand that in thi
instanc hesit doe not necessarili mean consent
in affair of thi natur a man is satisfi with small merci and
will to put up with inconveni that appear trifl in
comparison with the disast that might have overtaken him arthur
wa no except to the gener rule inde he wa profus in hi
thank and buoi up with all the confid of youth felt sure in
hi heart that he would soon find a wai to extinguish ani object
that might still linger in philip mind
hi wouldb fatherinlaw content himself with acknowledg hi
remark with courtesi and the interview came to an end
arthur gone howev hi host lost all hi calm of demeanour
and rise from hi untast meal pace up and down the room in
thought everyth had he reflect fallen out as he wish young
heigham wish to marri hi daughter and he could not wish for a
better husband save for the fatal which had sent that woman to him
on her fiend errand he would have given hi consent at onc and
been glad to give it not that he meant to refus ith had no such
idea and then he began to think what suppos that ladi bellami
embassi had been of a natur that he could entertain which it wa
not it would mean to him it would mean the realiz of the work
and aspir of twenti year it would mean hi reentri into the
properti and posit from which he had accord to hi own view
been unjustli oust it would mean last but not least triumph over
georg and now chanc mighti chanc as fool call provid had
at last thrown into hi hand a lever with which it would be easi to
toppl over everi stumblingblock that lai in hi path to triumph
more he might even be abl to spoil that egyptian georg give him
less than hi due
oh how he hunger for the broad acr of hi birthright long for
them as a lover long for hi lost bride the opportun would never
come again why should he throw it awai to do so would be to turn hi
cousin into an open and implac foe why should he allow thi girl
whose birth had bereft him of the onli creatur he had ever love
whose sex had alien the famili estat and for whose compani he
care noth to come as a destruct on hi plan she would be
welloff the man love her as for her be engag to thi young
heigham women soon got over those thing after all now that he came
to think of the matter calmli what valid caus wa there why the
thing should not be
and as he pace to and fro and thought thu an answer came into hi
mind for there rose up befor him a vision of hi dy wife and
there sound in hi ear the murmur of her halfforgotten voic
that for all it broken soft had with it last accent call
down god wing vengeanc and hi everlast doom on him who would
harm her unprotect child and feel that if he did thi thing on
him would be the vengeanc and the doom he thought of the shadow of
the night and grew afraid
when arthur and hi host met accord to their custom that even
no allus wa made on either side to their convers of the
afternoon nor did her father even speak a word to angela on the
subject life to all appear went on in the old hous precis
as though noth had happen philip did not attempt to put the
smallest restraint on arthur and hi daughter and studious shut hi
ey to the pretti obviou sign of their mutual affect for them
the long june dai were golden but all too short everi morn found
their mutual love more perfect but when the flake of crimson light
fade from the ski and night drop her veil over the tall tree
and peac lake by some miracl it had grown deeper and more
perfect still dai by dai arthur discov new charm in angela
here some hidden knowledg there an unsuspect grace and everywher
an allembrac chariti and love dai by dai he gaze deeper into the
depth of her mind and still there were more to plumb for it wa a
storehous of nobl thought and high ambitionsambit mani of
which could onli find fulfil in anoth world than thi and the
more he saw of her the prouder he wa to think that such a perfect
creatur should so dearli love himself and with the greater joi did
he look forward to that suprem and happi hour when he should call her
hi and so dai ad itself to dai and found them happi
inde the aspect of their fortun seem as smooth and smile as
the summer surfac of the lake about philip final consent to their
engag thei did not troubl themselv judg not unnatur
that hi conduct wa in itself a guarante of approv if he meant to
rais ani seriou object he would sure have done so befor
arthur would urg and angela would quit agre with him and wonder
what parent could find it in hi heart to object to her bonnieei
lover
what a merci provis of provid it is that throw a veil over
the futur onli to be pierc by the keenestei of scotchmen
where should we find a flavour in those unfrequ cup that the
shyest of the god joi hold to our yearn lip could we know of
the bitter that lurk in the tinsel bowl sure we have much to be
thank for but for noth should we be so grate as for thi
bless impot of foresight
but as it is often on the bluest dai that the mercuri begin to sink
beneath the breath of faroff hurrican so there is a warn spirit
implant in sensit mind that make them mistrust of too great
happi we feel that for most of us the wheel of our fortun
revolv too quickli to allow of a long continu of unbroken joi
arthur said angela on morn when eight dai had pass sinc
her father return from town we ar too happi we should throw
someth into the lake
i have not got a ring except the on you gave me he answer for
hi signet wa on hi finger so unless we sacrific aleck or the
raven i dont know what it is to be
dont joke arthur i tell you we ar too happi
could arthur have seen through an acr or so of undergrowth as angela
utter these word he would have perceiv a veri smart pageboi
with the bellami crest on hi button deliv a letter to philip
it is true that there wa noth particularli alarm about that
but it content might have given a point to angela forebod it
ran thu
rewtham hous mondai
my dear mr caresfoot
with refer to our convers last week about your daughter
and g can you come over and have a quiet chat with me thi
afternoon
sincer your
ann bellami
philip read thi note and then reread it know in hi heart that
now wa hi opportun to act up to hi convict and put an end
to the whole transact in a few decis word but a man who ha
for so mani year given place to the devil of avaric even though it
be avaric with a legitim object cannot shake himself free from
hi cloth in a moment even when as in philip case honour and
right to sai noth of a still more power factor superstit
speak so loudli in hi ear sure he thought there would be no
harm in hear what she had to sai he could explain hi reason for
have noth to do with the matter so much better in person such
mental struggl have onli on end present the smart pageboi bore
back thi note
dear ladi bellami
i will be with you at halfpast three
pc
it wa with veri curiou sensat that philip wa that afternoon
shown into a richli furnish boudoir in rewtham hous he had not
been in that room sinc he had talk to maria lee sit on that
veri sofa now occupi by ladi bellami still beauti form and he
could not but feel that it wa a place of evil omen for him
ladi bellami rose to greet him with her most fascin smile
thi is veri kind she said as she motion him to a seat which
philip afterward discov had been carefulli arrang so as to put
hi featur in the full light whilst sit on the sofa her own
were conceal well mr caresfoot she began after a littl
paus i suppos i had better come to the point at onc first of
all i presum that as you anticip would be the case there
exist some sort of understand between mr heigham and your
daughter
philip nod
well your cousin is as determin as ever about the matter inde
he is simpli infatu or bewitch i realli dont know which
i am sorri for it ladi bellami as i cannot
on moment mr caresfoot first let me tell you hi offer then we
can talk it over he offer condition on hi marriag with your
daughter to sell you the isleworth estat at a fair valuat
hereaft to be agre upon and to make a larg settlement
and what part doe he wish me to plai in the matter
thi first you must get rid of young heigham and prevent him from
hold ani commun either with angela herself or with ani
other person connect with thi place for on year from the date of
hi departur secondli you must throw no obstacl in georg path
thirdli if requir you must dismiss her old nurs pigott
it cannot be ladi bellami i came here to tell you so i dare not
forc my daughter into such a marriag for all the estat in
england
ladi bellami laugh
it is amus she said to see a father afraid of hi own
daughter but you ar overhasti mr caresfoot who ask you to
forc her all you ar ask to do is not to interfer and leav the
rest to myself and georg you will have noth to do with it on wai
or the other nor will ani respons rest with you besid it
is veri probabl that your cousin will live down hi fanci or some
other obstacl will aris to put an end to the thing in which case
mr heigham will come back at the end of hi year probat and
event will take their natur cours it is onli wise and right that
you should try the constanc of these young lover instead of let
them marri out of hand if on the other hand angela should in the
cours of the year declar a prefer for her cousin sure that
will be no affair of your
i dont understand what your interest is in thi matter ladi
bellami

into philip guilti thought as he wend hi homeward wai we will
not inquir and inde for all the warm glow that the thousand pound
chequ in hi pocket diffus through hi system thei were not to be
envi perhap no scoundrel present at heart such a miser object
to himself and all who know him as the scoundrel who attempt to
deceiv himself and whilst reap it profit tri to shoulder the
respons of hi iniqu on to the back of other
unfortun in thi prosaic world of bargain on cannot receiv
chequ for on thousand pound without in some shape or form give
a quid pro quo now philip quid wa to rid hi hous and the
neighbourhood of arthur heigham hi guest and hi daughter lover
it wa not a task he like but the unearn chequ in hi breech
pocket continu remind him of the oblig it entail
when arthur came to smoke hi pipe with hi host that even the
latter look so gloomi and depress that he wonder to himself if
he wa go to be treat to a repetit of the shadow scene littl
guess that there wa someth much more person unpleas
befor him
heigham philip said suddenli and look studious in the other
direct i want to speak to you i have been think over our
convers of about a week ago on the subject of your engag to
angela and have now come to a final determin i mai sai at onc
that i approv of you in everi wai here hi hearer heart bound
with delight but under all the circumst i dont think that i
should be right in sanction an immedi engag you ar not
suffici sure of each other for that i mai seem oldfashion
but i am a great believ in the virtu of constanc and im anxiou
in your own interest to put your and angela to the test the
term that i can offer you ar these you must leav here tomorrow
and must give me your word of honour as a gentlemanwhich i know will
be the most effectu guarante that i can take from youthat you
will not for the space of a year either attempt to see angela again
or to hold ani written commun with her or anybodi in ani wai
connect with her the year end you can return and should you
both still be of the same mind you can then marri her as soon as you
like if you declin to acced to these termswhich i believ to be
to your mutual ultim advantagei must refus my consent to the
engag altogeth
a silenc follow thi speech the match that arthur had lit befor
philip began burnt itself out between hi finger without hi
appear to suffer ani particular inconveni and now hi pipe
fell with a crash into the grate and broke into fragmentsa fit
symbol of the blow dealt to hi hope for some moment he wa so
complet overwhelm at the idea of lose angela for a whole long
year lose her as complet as though she were dead that he could
not answer at length he found hi voic and said hoars
your ar hard term
i cannot argu the point with you heigham such as thei ar thei
ar my term found on what i consid i ow to my daughter do you
accept them
i cannot answer you offhand my happi and angela ar too
vital concern to allow me to do so i must consult her first
veri good i have no object but you must let me have your answer
by ten tomorrow
had arthur onli known hi own strength and philip weaknessth
strength that honesti and honour ever have in the face of dishonour
and dishonestyhad he known the hesit feebl of philip
avaricetoss mind how easi it would have been for him to tear hi
bald argument to shed and by the bare exhibit of unshaken
purpos to confound and disallow hi determinationshad he then and
there refus to agre to hi ultimatum so divid wa philip in hi
mind and so shaken by superstiti fear that he would have accept
it as an omen and have yield to a decis of charact that had no
real exist in himself but he did not know inde how could he
know and he wa besid too thorough a gentleman to allow himself
to suspect foul plai and so too sad for talk and oppress by the
dread sens of come separ from her whom he love more dearli
than hi life he sought hi room there to think and pace to pace
and think until the star had set
when weari out at length he threw himself into bed it wa onli to
exchang bad for wors for on such occas sleep is wors than
wake it is so full of dream big with come pain shortli
after dawn he got up again and went into the garden and listen to
the bird sing their matin hymn but he wa in no mood for the
song of bird howev sweet and it wa a posit relief to him
when old jake emerg hi cross face set in the glad of the
morn like a sullen cloud in the blue sky and began to do
someth to hi favourit bed of cabbag not that arthur wa fond
of old jake on the contrari ever sinc the coffinstand
convers which betrai he consid a malevol mind he
detest him person but still he set a fanci valu on him becaus
he wa connect with the daili life of hi betroth
and then at last out came angela have spi him from behind the
curtain of her window cloth in the same white gown in which he had
first beheld her and which he consequ consid the prettiest
of frock never did she look more love than when she came walk
toward him that morn with her light proud step which wa so
full of grace and womanli digniti never had he thought her more sweet
and heartcompel than when have first made sure that jake had
retreat to feed hi pig she shyli lift her bright face to be
greet with hi kiss but she wa quick of sympathi and had learn
to read him like an open page and befor hi lip had fairli fallen
on her own she knew that thing had gone amiss
oh what is it arthur she said with a littl pant of fear
be brave dear and i will tell you and in somewhat choki tone he
recount word for word what had pass between her father and
himself
she listen in perfect silenc and bore the blow as a brave woman
should when he had finish she said with a littl tremor in her
voic
you will not forget me in a year will you arthur
he kiss her by wai of answer and then thei agre to go togeth to
philip and try to turn him from hi purpos
breakfast wa not a cheer meal that dai and pigott notic the
prevail depress remark with sarcasm that thei might for
all appear to the contrari have been marri for twenti year
but even thi spirit salli did not provok a laugh ten oclock the
hour that wa to decid their fate came all too soon and it wa with
veri anxiou heart that thei took their wai to the studi philip who

which i am prepar to consent to your engag
ye arthur ha told me and it is to implor you to modifi them that
we have come father thei ar cruel termsto be dead to each other
for a whole long year
i cannot help it angela i am sorri to inflict pain upon either of
you but i have arriv at them entir in your own interest and
after a great deal of anxiou thought believ me a year probat
will be veri good for both of you it is not probabl that where my
onli child is concern i should wish to do anyth except what is

arthur look rebellion at angela philip saw it and ad
of cours you can defi meit is i believ rather the fashion for
girl nowadai to do sobut if you do you must both clearli
understand first that you cannot marri without my consent till the
first of mai next or veri nearli a year henc when angela come of

came there
if it had not been angela wish i would never have agre i think

satisfactori reason for them for you have not shown us ani but sinc
she take thi view of the matter and becaus so far as i can see
you have complet corner us i suppos i must you ar her father
and cannot in natur wish to thwart her happi and if you have ani
plan of caus her to forget mei dont want to be conceit but i
believ that it will fail here angela smile somewhat sadli so
unless on of us di befor the year is up i shall come back to be
marri on the 9th of june next year
realli my dear heigham your wai of talk is so aggress that
some father might be tempt to ask you not to come back at all but
perhap it is under the circumst excus
you would probabl think so if you were in my place blurt out
arthur

attempt either in person or by letter no commun with angela
or with anybodi about thi place for on year from todai
on the condit that at the end of the year i mai return and marri

pleasur of present thi young ladi to you for good and all on thi
dai next year goodby for the present i shall see you befor you
go
it is pain to have to record that when arthur got outsid the door
and out of angela hear he curs philip in hi grief and anger
for the space of some minut
to linger over those last hour could onli be distress to the
sympathet reader of thi histori more especi if he or she ha
ever had the misfortun to pass through such a time in their own
proper person the dai of ani on departur is alwai wretch but
much more is it wretch when the person depart is a lover whose
face will not be seen and of whom no postman will bear tide for a
whole long year
some comfort howev these two took in look forward to that
joyou dai when the year of probat should have been gather to it
predecessor and in make the most minut arrang for their
wed how angela wa to warn mr fraser that hi servic would be
requir where thei should go to for their honeymoon and even of
what flower the wed bouquet which arthur wa to bring down from
town with him should be compos
and thu the hour pass awai all too quickli and each of them
strove to be merri in order to keep up the spirit of the other but
it is not in human natur to feel cheer with a lump of ic upon the
heart dinner wa even more dismal than breakfast and pigott who had
been inform of the impend misfortun and who wa distrust of
philip motiv though she did not like to add to the gener gloom
by sai so made after the manner of halfeduc peopl a
pain and infecti exhibit of her grief
poor aleck said angela when the time drew near bend down over
the dog to hide a tear as she had onc befor bent down to hide a
blush poor aleck i shall miss you almost as much as your master
you will not miss him angela becaus i am go to make you a
present of him if you will keep him
that is veri good of you dear i shall be glad to have him for your
sake
well keep him love he is a good dog he will quit have
transfer hi allegi by the time i come back i hope you wont
have done the same angela
oh arthur why will you so often make me angri by sai such
thing the sun will forget to shine befor i forget you
hush love i did not mean it and he took her in hi arm and so
thei sat there togeth under the oak where first thei had met hand
in hand and heart to heart and it wa at thi moment that the self
reliant strength and more beauti seren of angela charact as
compar with her lover came into visibl plai for whilst as the
moment of separ drew nigh he could scarc contain hi grief
she on the other hand grew more and more calm strengthen hi
weak with her quiet power and bid him seek consol in hi
troubl at the hand of him who for hi own purpos decre it
dearest she said in answer to hi complain there ar so mani
thing in the world that we cannot understand and yet thei must be
right and lead to a good end what mai happen to us befor thi year
is out of cours we cannot sai but i feel that all love is immort
and that there is a perfect life await us if not in thi world
then in the next rememb dear that these few year ar after all
but as a breath to the gener air or as that dewdrop to the water
of the lake when compar with the futur that await us there and
that until we attain that futur we cannot realli know each other or
the true mean and purpos of our love so look forward to it
without fear dear heart and if it should chanc that i should pass
out of your life or that other ti should spring up round you that
shall forbid the outward express of our love here arthur
start and wa about to interrupt but she stop him do not
start arthur who can read the futur stranger thing have happen
and if i sai such a thing should come about in our case then
rememb i implor you that in that futur li the answer to the
puzzl of the world and turn your ey to it as to the horizon
beyond which you will find me wait for you and not onli me but
all that you have ever love onli dear try to be a good man and
love me alwai
he look at her in wonder
angela he said what ha made you so differ from other women
with all whom i have known love is an affair of passion or amus
of the world and the dai but your gaze toward heaven and look to
find it real utter in the still of etern to be love by
you my dear would be worth a centuri of sorrow
at last the moment came as all moment good and bad must come to
pigott who wa cry he gave a hug and a fivepound note to aleck
a pat on the head to philip who could not look him in the face a
shake of the hand and to angela who brave smile into hi eyesa
long last kiss
but when the cruel wheel began to crunch upon the gravel the great
tear well to her ey blot him from sight blindli she made her
wai up to her room and throw herself upon the bed let her
unrestrain sorrow loos feel that she wa inde desol and
alon
chapter xxxi
when angela wa still quit a child the perman inhabit of
sherborn lane king william street in the citi of london us to
note a veri pretti girl of small statu and modest wai pass out
everi even after the citi gentlemen had lock up their offic
and gone homefrom the quiet of the lane into the roar and rush of
the citi thi young girl wa mildr jame the onli daughter of a
struggl a veri struggl citi doctor and her daili mission wa
to go to the cheap market and bui the provis that were to last
the sherborn lane household for her father live in the same room
that he practis in for the ensu twentyfour hour the world wa
a hard place for poor mildr in those dai of provis hunt when
so littl monei had to pai for so mani necessari and to provid
also for the luxuri that were necessari to her invalid mother
some year later when she wa a sweet maiden of eighteen her mother
di but medic competit wa keen in sherborn lane and her
remov did not greatli allevi the pressur of poverti at last
on even when she wa about twenti year of ag a certain mr
carr an old gentleman with whom her father had some acquaint
sent up a card with a pencil messag on it to the effect that he
would be glad to see dr jame
run mildr said her father and tell mr carr that i will be
with him in a minut it will never do to see a new patient in thi
coat
mildr depart and glide into the gloomi consultingroom like a
sunbeam deliv her messag to the old gentleman who appear to
be in some pain and prepar to return
dont go awai almost shout the ag patient i have crush my
finger in a door and it hurt most confoundedli you ar someth to
look at in thi hole and distract my attent
mildr thought to herself that thi wa an odd wai of pai a
compliment if it wa meant for on but then old gentlemen with
crush finger ar not given to weigh their word
ar you dr jame daughter he ask present
ye sir
ugh i have live most of my life in sherborn lane and never saw
anyth half so pretti in it befor confound thi finger
at thi moment the doctor himself arriv and want to dismiss
mildr but mr carr who wa a headstrong old gentleman vow that
no on els should hold hi injur hand whilst it wa dress and so
she stai just long enough for him to fall as complet in love with
her shelllik face wa though he had been twenti instead of nearli
seventi
now mr carr wa not remark for good look and in addit to
have seen out so mani summer had also buri two wive it will
therefor be clear that he wa scarc the suitor that a love
girl consciou of capac for deep affect would have select
of her own free will but on the other hand he wa honest and kind
heart and what wa more to the point perhap the wealthiest wine
merchant in the citi mildr resist as long as she could but want
is a hard master and a father argument ar difficult to answer
and in the end she marri him and what is more made him a good and
faith wife
she never had ani caus to regret it for he wa kind itself
toward her and when he di some five year afterward have no
children of hi own he left her sole legate of all hi enorm
fortun bound up by no restrict as to remarriag about thi
time also her father di and she wa left as much alon in the world
as it is possibl for a young and pretti woman possess in her own
right between twenti and thirti thousand a year to be
needless to sai mr carr wa thenceforth on of the catch of her
gener but nobodi could catch her though she alon knew how mani
had tri onc she made a list of all the peopl who had propos to
her it includ amongst other a bishop two peer three member of
parliament no less than five armi offic an american and a
dissent clergyman
it is perfectli marvel my dear she said to her companion
agatha terri how fond peopl ar of twenti thousand a year and yet
thei all said that thei love me for myself that is all except the
dissent who want me to help to feed hi flock and i like him
the best of the lot becaus he wa the honestest
mr carr had a beauti hous in grosvenor squar a place in
leicestershir where she hunt a littl a place in the isl of
wight that she rare visit and lastli a place at madeira where
she live for nearli half the year there never had been a breath of
scandal against her name nor had she given caus for ani as for
love she would sai the onli thing she love were beetl and
mummi for she wa a clever naturalist and a faith student of
the lore of the ancient egyptian the beetl she would explain had
been the connect link between the two scienc sinc beetl had
led her to scarabaei and scarabaei to the human husk with which thei
ar to be found but thi statement though amus wa not strictli
accur as she had in realiti contract the tast from her late
husband who had left her a larg collect of egyptian antiqu
i do ador a mummi she would sai i am small enough in mind and
bodi alreadi but it make me feel inch smaller and i like to
measur my own diminut
she wa not much of a reader life wa she declar too short to
wast in studi but when she did take up a book it wa gener of
a natur that most women of her class would have call stiff and
then she could read it without go to sleep
in addit to these occup mr carr had had variou craze at
differ stage of her widowhood which had now endur for some five
year she had travel she had gonein for art onc she had
specul a littl but find that for a woman it wa a lose
game she wa too shrewd to continu thi last pastim but she alwai
came back to her beetl and her mummi
still with all her monei her place her offer of marriag and her
selfmad occup mildr carr wa essenti a weari woman
sunk deep in eas and sate with her life within that littl frame
of her there beat a great activ heart ever urg her onward
toward an unknown end she would describ herself as an ill
regul woman and the descript wa not without justic for she
did not possess that placid even mind which is so necessari to the
comfort of english ladi and which enabl mani of them to buri a
husband or a lover as composedli as thei take him she would have
given world to be abl to fall in love with some on to fill up the
daili empti of her exist with anoth joi and grief but
she could not men pass befor her in endless process all
sort and condit of them and for the most part were anxiou to
marri her but thei might as well have been a string of wax doll for
aught she could care about them to her ey thei were noth more
than a success of frockcoat and tall hat full of shine and
empti signifi noth for their opinion too and that of the
societi which thei help to form she had a most complet and wrong
head contempt she care noth for the ordinari law of social
life and wa prepar to break through them on emerg as a wasp
break through a spider web perhap she guess that a good deal of
break would be forgiven to the owner of such a love face and
more than twenti thousand a year with all thi she wa extrem
observ and possess unknown to herself great power of mind
and great though dormant capac for passion in short thi
littl woman with the babi face smile and seren as the blue sky
that hide the gather hurrican wa rather odder than the major
of her sex which is perhap sai a great deal
on dai about a week befor arthur depart from the abbei hous
agatha terri wa sit in the blue drawingroom in the hous in
grosvenor squar when mr carr came in almost at a run slam the
door behind her and plump herself down in a chair with a sigh of
relief
agatha give order to pack up we will go to madeira by the next
boat
good graciou mildr across that dread bai again and just
think how hot it will be and the begin of the season too
now agatha im go and there an end of it so it is no us
argu you can stai here and give a seri of ball and dinner if
you like
nonsens dear me give parti inde and you at madeira why it
just as though you ask ruth to entertain the reaper without naomi
ill go and give the order but i do hope that it will be calm why
do you want to go now
ill tell you lord minster ha been propos to me again and
announc hi intent of go on do so till i accept him you
know he ha just got into the cabinet so he ha celebr the event
by ask me to marri him for the third time
poor fellow perhap he is veri fond of you
not a bit of it he is fond of my good look and my monei i will
tell you the substanc of hi speech thi morn he stood like thi
with hi hand in hi pocket and said i am now a cabinet minist
it is a good thing that a cabinet minist should have somebodi
present to sit at the head of hi tabl you ar present i
appreci beauti when i have time to think about it i observ that
you ar beauti i am not veri welloff for my posit you on the
other hand ar immens rich with your monei i can in time
becom prime minist it is consequ evid to my advantag
that you should marri me and i have sacrif a veri import
appoint in order to come and settl it
agatha laugh
and how did you answer him
in hi own style lord minster i said i am for the third time
honour by your flatter propos but i have no wish to ornament
your tabl no desir to expos my beauti to your perpetu
admir and no ambit to advanc your polit career i do not
love you and i had rather becom the wife of a crossingsweep that
i love than that of a member of the govern for whom i have
everi respect but no affect
as the wife of a crossingsweep it is probabl he answer
that you would be miser as my wife you would certainli be
admir and power and consequ happi
lord minster i said you have studi human natur but veri
superfici if you have not learnt that it is better for a woman to
be miser with the man she love than admir power and
consequ happi with on who ha no attract for her
your remark is interest he repli but i think that there is
someth paradox about it i must be go now as i have onli
five minut to get to westminst but i will think it over and
answer it when we renew our convers which i propos to do veri
shortli and he wa gone befor i could get in anoth word
but why should that make you go to madeira
becaus my dear if i dont so sure as i am a live woman that
man will tire me out and marri me and i dislik him and dont want
to marri him i have a strong will but hi is of iron
and so it came to pass that the name of mr carr miss terri and
three servant appear upon the passeng list of messr donald
curri co royal mail steamship warwick castl due to sail for
madeira and the cape port on the 14th of june
chapter xxxii
arthur arriv in town in a melancholi condit hi wa a
tempera peculiarli liabl to suffer from attack of depress
and he had with some excus a suffici sever on on him now do
what he would he could not for a singl hour free hi mind from the
sick long to see or hear from angela that in addit to the
mental distress it occas him amount almost to a physic pain
after two or three dai of loung about hi clubfor he wa in no
mood for go outh began to feel that thi sort of thing wa
intoler and that it wa absolut necessari for him to go
somewher or do someth
it so happen that just after he had come to thi decis he
overheard two men who were sit at the next tabl to him in the
club diningroom talk of the island of madeira and speak of it
as a charm place he accept thi as an omen and determin that
to madeira he would go and inde the place would suit him as well
as ani other to get through a portion of hi year of probat in
and whilst afford a complet chang of scene would not be too far
from england
and so it came to pass that on the morrow arthur found himself in the
offic of messr donald curri for the purpos of book hi berth
in the vessel that wa due to sail on the 14th there he wa inform
by the veri affabl clerk who assist him to choos hi cabin that
the vessel wa unusu empti and that up to the present time
berth had been taken for onli five ladi and two of them jewess
howev the clerk ad by wai of consol thi on
point to mr carr name on the list is as good as a cargo and
he whistl express
what do you mean ask arthur hi curios slightli excit
i meanmi word here she come
at that moment the swing door of the offic were push open and
there came through them on of the sweetest daintiest littl women
arthur had ever seen she wa no longer quit young she might be
eight and twenti or thirti but on the other hand matur had but
ad to the charm of youth she had big brown ey that arthur
thought could probabl look languish if thei chose and that even
in repos were full of express a face soft and bloom as a
peach and round as a babi surmount by a quantiti of nutbrown
hair the veri sweetest mouth the lip rather full and just show
a line of pearl and lastli what look rather odd on such an
infantil counten a firm squar and veri determin if veri
diminut chin for the rest it wa difficult to sai which wa the
most perfect her figur or her dress
all of which of cours had littl interest for arthur but what did
rather startl him wa her voic when she spoke from such a woman
on would natur have expect a voic of a correspond natur
name on of the soft and murmur order but her on the
contrari though sweet wa decid and clear as a bell and with a
peculiar ring in it that he would have recogn amongst a thousand
other
on her entranc arthur step on on side
i have come to sai she said with a slight bow of recognit to
the clerk that i have chang my mind about my berth instead of the
starboard deck cabin i should like to have the port i think that it
will be cooler at thi time of year and also will you pleas make
arrang for three hors
i am excess sorri mr carr the clerk answer but the port
cabin is engagedin fact thi gentleman ha just taken it
oh in that casewith a littl blushther is an end of the
question
by no mean interrupt arthur it is a matter of perfect
indiffer to me where i go i beg that you will take it
oh thank you you ar veri good but i could not think of rob
you of your cabin
i must implor you to do so rather than there should be ani
difficulti i will go below and then address the clerk be so
kind as to chang the cabin
i ow you mani thank for your courtesi said mr carr with a
littl curtsei
arthur took off hi hat

iron side the fresh strong smell of the sea the tall mast
point skyward like gigant finger the chime of the bell upon
the bridg the sleepi steward and the stuffi cabin were all a
pleasant variat from the everydai monotoni of exist and
contribut toward the conclus that life wa still partial worth
live even when it could not be live with angela inde so much
ar we the creatur of circumst and so liabl to be influenc
by surround that arthur who a few hour befor had been
plung into the depth of depress turn into hi narrow berth
after a tremend struggl with the sheetswhich steward arrang on
a principl incomprehens to landlubb and probabl onli
partial understood by themselveswith consider satisfact and
a pleasur sens of excit
the next morn or rather the earlier part of it he devot when
he wa not think about angela to arrang hi good and chattel
in hi small domain to examin the love sceneri of dartmouth
harbourth sight of which is enough to make ani outwardbound
individu bitterli regret hi determin to quit hi nativ land

ici stolid which character the trueborn briton but the great
event of the morn wa the arriv of the mailtrain bring the

amongst these latter he had no difficulti in recogn the two
jewess of whom the clerk in the offic had spoken who were

to be a gover at the cape and who to judg from the intens
melancholi of her counten did not particularli enjoi the
prospect but with the except of some heavi baggag that wa be
work up from a cargoboat by the donkeyengin and a luxuri
canechair on the deck that bore her name no sign were there of mr
carr
present the purser sent round the headsteward a gentleman whom
arthur mistook for the first mate so smart wa hi uniform to
collect the letter and it wrung him not a littl to think that he
alon could send none the bell sound to warn all not sail to
hurri to their boat but still there wa noth to be seen of hi
acquaint of the offic and to speak the truth he wa just a
littl disappoint for what he had seen of her had piqu hi
curios and made him anxiou to see more
i cant wait ani longer he heard the captain sai she must come on

it wa full twelv oclock and the last rope wa be loos from
the moor tingt went the engineroom bell thudthud
start the great screw that would not stop again for so mani restless
hour the huge vessel shudder throughout her frame like an

ahead next a quartermast came with two men to hoist up the
gangwai when suddenli a boat shot alongsid and hook on amongst
the occup of which arthur had no difficulti in recogn mr
carr who sat laugh like pleasur at the helm the other
occup of the boat who were not laugh he guess to be her
servant and the ladi who figur on the passengerlist as miss terri

now then agatha call out mr carr from the sternsheet be
quick and jump up
my dear mildr i cant go up there i cant inde why the
thing move
but you must go up or els be pull up with a rope here i will
show the wai and move down the boat she sprang boldli as it
rose with the swell into the stalwart arm of the sailor who wa
wait on the gangwai landingstag and thenc ran up the step to
the deck
veri well i am go to madeira i dont know what you ar go to
do but you must make up your mind quick

the hand that wa not emploi in hold on
john call mr carr to a servant who wa behind miss terri and
look consider alarm dont stand there like a fool put miss

mr carr wa evid accustom to be obei for thu admonish
john seiz the struggl and shriek miss terri and bore her to
the edg of the boat where she wa caught by two sailor and amidst
the cheer of excit passeng fairli drag on to the deck
oh mr carr said the chief offic reproachfulli when miss
terri had been satisfactorili deposit on a bench you ar late

oh ye we should have mr carr the skipper heard about it
becaus he wait for you befor

mr thompson laugh and pass on at thi moment mr carr
perceiv arthur and bow to him thei fell into convers
about the sceneri through which the boat wa pass on her wai to the
open sea befor veri long inde as soon as the vessel began to
rise and fall upon the swell thi talk wa interrupt by a voic
from the seat where miss terri had been place
mildr it said i do wish you would not come to sea i am
begin to feel ill
and no wonder if you will insist upon come up ladder head
downward where john he will help you to your cabin the deck on
next to mine
but john had vanish with a parcel

till we drop anchor at madeira
if i live so long murmur the invalid
arthur now made hi bow and depart wonder how two women so
dissimilar as mr carr and miss terri came to be live togeth as
it is a piec of curios that the reader mai share perhap it had
better be explain
miss terri wa a middleag rel of mr carr late husband who
had by a seri of misfortun been left quit destitut her distress
have come to the knowledg of mildr carr she with the kind
heart promptitud that distinguish her at onc came to her aid
paid her debt and brought her to her own hous to stai where she
had remain ever sinc under the titl of companion these two women
live thu togeth had noth whatsoev in common save that miss
terri took some reflect interest in beetl as for travel
have been brought up and live in the same hous of the same counti
town until she reach the ag of fortyf it wa as mai be
imagin altogeth obnoxi to her inde it is more than
doubt if she retain ani clear impress whatsoev of the place
she visit a set of foreign hole as she would call them
contemptu miss terri wa in short neither clever nor strong
mind but so long as she could be in the compani of her belov
mildr whom she regard with mingl rever and affect she
wa perfectli happi oddli enough thi affect wa reciproc
and there probabl wa nobodi in the world for whom mr carr care so
much as her cousin by marriag agatha terri and yet it would be
imposs to imagin two women more dissimilar
not long after thei had left dartmouth the afternoon set in dull and
toward even the sea freshen suffici to send most of the
passeng below leav those who remain to be final dispers
by the penetr drizzl that is gener to be met with off the
english coast arthur left alon on the heav deck survei the
scene and thought it veri desol around wa a grei wast of
toss water illumin here and there by the set rai of an
angri sun abov a wild and windi sky with not even a seagul in
all it space and in the far distanc a white and fade line which
wa the shore of england
faint it grew and fainter yet and as it disappear he thought of
angela and a yearn sorrow fell upon him when he wonder sadli
should he again look into her ey and hold that proud beauti in hi
arm what fate await them in the futur that stretch befor them
dim as the darken ocean and more uncertain ala he could not
tell he onli felt that it wa veri bitter to be part thu from her
to whom had been given hi whole heart love to know that everi
fleet moment widen a breach alreadi far too wide and not to know
if it would again be narrow or if thi farewel would be the last
then he thought if it should be the last if she should die or desert
him what would hi life be worth to him a conscious within him
answer noth and in a degre hi conclus wa right for
although it is fortun not often in the power of ani singl
passion to render life altogeth worthless it is certain that when
it strike in youth there is no sick so sore as that of the
heart no sorrow more keen and no evil more last than those
connect with it disappoint and it grief for other sorrow
life ha salv and consol but a nobl and endur passion is
not all of thi world and to cure it sting we must look to someth
beyond thi world quackeri other grief can find sympathi and
express and becom absorb littl by littl in the varieti of
love issu but love as it is and should be understoodnot the
faint ghost that arrai itself in stolen robe and sai i am love
but love the strong and the immort the passkei to the happi ski
the angel cipher we read but cannot understandsuch love as thi

the morn after the vessel left dartmouth brought with it love
weather brisk and clear with a fresh breez that just top the

and as thei talk madeira in all it summer glori loom up out
of the ocean for thei had pass the deserta and porto santo by
night and for a while thei were lost in the contempl of on of
the most love and verdant scene that the world can show befor
thei had well examin it howev the vessel had drop her anchor
and wa surround by boat full of customhous offici boat full

then thei shook hand and took their respect wai shetogeth
with the unfortun miss terri who look like a resuscit corps
on to the steamlaunch that wa wait for her and he in the boat
belong to mile hotel
chapter xxxiv
a minut or two after the boat in which arthur wa be pilot to
the shore under the guidanc of the manag of mile hotel had left
the side of the vessel mr carr steamlaunch shot up alongsid of
them it brasswork gleam in the sunlight like polish gold on
the deck near the littl wheel stood mr carr herself and by her
side her martial cloak around her lai miss terri still as ani log
mr heigham said mr carr in a voic that sound across the
water like a silver bell i forgot that you will not be abl to find
your wai to my place by yourself tomorrow so i will send down a
bullockcar to fetch you you have to travel about with bullock here
you know goodby and befor he could answer the launch head
wa round and she wa tear through the swell at the rate of
fourteen knot
that her privat launch said the manag of the hotel to arthur
it is the quickest in the island and she alwai goe at full steam
she must have come some wai round to tell you that too there her
place over there
mr carr come here everi year doe she not
oh ye everi year but she is veri earli thi year our season doe
not begin yet you know she is a great bless to the place she
give so much awai to the poor peasant at first she us to come
with old mr carr and a wonder nurs thei sai she made to the old
gentleman till he di
doe she entertain much
not as a rule but sometim she give great ball splendid affair
and a seri of dinnerparti that ar the talk of the island she
hardli ever goe out anywher which make the ladi in the place
angri but i believ that thei all go to her ball and dinner
mostli she spend her time up in the hill collect butterfli
and beetl she ha got the most wonder collect of egyptian
curios up at the hous there too though why she keep them here
instead of in england i am sure i dont know her husband began the
collect when he wa a young man and collect all hi life and
she ha gone on with it sinc
i wonder that she ha not marri again
well it cant be for want of ask if half of what thei sai is
true for accord to that everi singl gentleman under fifti who
ha been at madeira dure the last five year ha had a try at her
but she wouldnt look at on of them but of cours that is gossip
and here we ar at the landingplac sit steadi sir those fellow
will pull the boat up
had it not been for the preoccupi and uncomfort state of hi
mind that took the flavour out of all that he did and persist
thrust a skeleton amidst the flower of everi landscap arthur should
by right have enjoi himself veri much at madeira
to live in on of the lofti room of mile hotel protect by
thick wall and cool green shutter to feel that you ar enjoi
all the advantag of a warm climat without it drawback and that
too howev much peopl in england mai be shiveringwhich thei
mostli do all the year roundi in itself a luxuri and so it is if
the dai is hot to dine chiefli off fish and fruit and such fruit
and then to exchang the diningroom for the cool portico with the
seabreez sweep through it and pipe in hand to sink into a
slumber that even the diabol shriek of the parrot ti by the
leg in a line below ar powerless to disturb or if you be energet
i speak of madeira energyy mai stroll down the littl terrac
walk under the shade of your landlord vine and contempl the
grow mass of greeneri that in thi heavenli island make a garden
you can do more than thi even for have penetr through the
brilliant flowerb and recruit exhaust natur under a
figtre you can engag in true english fashion in a game of lawn
tenni which done you will again seek the shade of the creep
vine or spread banana and in a springi hammock take your well
earn repos
all these thing ar the quintess of luxuri so much so that he
who ha onc enjoi them will long to turn lotoseat forget the
pain and labori past and live and die at mile hotel oh
madeira gem of the ocean land of pineclad mountain that foolish
men love to climb vallei where wise on much prefer to rest and of

recollect of the open drain the illfavour priest and
portugues offici effectu prevent
on the follow morn at twelv punctual arthur wa inform
that the convey had arriv to fetch him he went down and wa

follow by at least a score of beggar each afflict with some
peculiar and dread deform or diseas and thu in triumphal

hous over the bridg that span the vast open drain past the
ochrecolour cathedr down the promenad edg with great
magnoliatre that made the air heavi with their perfum and where
twice a week the band plai and the portugues offici march up and
down in all the pomp and panopli of offic onward through the dip
where the town lope downward to the sea then up again through more

wheel through some iron gate and he is in fairyland on each side
of the carriagewai there spread a garden calcul to make english
horticulturist gnash their teeth with envi through the bower of

here the cabbag palm shot it smooth and lofti trunk high into the

a detach build with a broad verandah face the sea scarc
ten feet from thi verandah and on the edg of the sheer precipic
wa built a low wall lean over which arthur could hear the
wavelet lap against the hollow rock two hundr feet beneath him
here thei stop for a moment to look at the vast expans of ocean

and to gain it thei pass under the bough of a larg magnoliatre
go through glass door that open outward into the verandah mr
carr enter a room luxuri furnish as a boudoir thi had
appar no other exit and arthur wa begin to wonder where the
museum could be when she took a tini bramah kei from her watchchain
and with it open a door that wa paper and paint to match the
wall exactli he follow her and found himself in a stone passag
dimli light from abov and slope downward that led to a doorwai
graven in the rock on the model of those to be seen at the entranc
of egyptian templ
now mr heigham she said fling open anoth door and step
forward you ar about the enter the hall of the dead
he went in and a strang sight met hi gaze thei were stand in
the centr of on side of a vast cave that ran right and left at
right angl to the passag the light pour into it in great rai
from skylight in the roof and by it he could see that it wa
hollow out of the virgin rock and measur some sixti feet or more
in length by about forti wide and thirti high down the length of
each side of the great chamber ran a line of six polish sphinx
which had been hewn out of the surround granit on the model of
those at carnac whilst the wall were elabor paint after the
fashion of an egyptian sepulchr here osiri held hi dread tribun
on the spirit of the depart here the warrior sped onward in hi
charg chariot here the harper swept hi sound chord and here
again crown with lotu flower those whose corps lai around held
their joyou festiv
in the respect centr of each end of the stone chamber a colossu
tower in it silent and unearthli grandeur that to the right wa a
statu of osiri judg of the soul of the dead seat on hi
judgmentseat and hold in hi hand the sourc and the benthead
sceptr face him at the other end of the hall wa the effigi of the
mighti rams hi broad brow encircl by that kingli symbol which
few in the world histori have worn so proudli and hi nobl
featur impress those who gaze upon them from ag to ag with a
sens of scorn power and melancholi calm such as doe not belong
to the counten of the men of their own time and all around under
thi solemn guardianship each upon a polish slab of marbl and
enclos in a case of thick glass lai the corps of the egyptian
dead swath in numberless wrap as in their dai the true
religion that thei held wa swath in symbol and in mummeri
here were to be found the highpriest of the mysteri of isi the
astronom whose lore could read the propheci that ar written in
the star the dark magician the renown warrior the nobl the
musician with hi cymbal by hi side the fair maiden who hadso
said her cedar coffinboardsdi of love and sorrow and the royal
babe all sleep the same sleep and wait the same awaken
thi princess must have been well known to joseph that mai have been
her who rescu mose from the water whilst the babe belong to a
dynasti of which the histori wa alreadi merg into tradit when
the great pyramid rear it head on egypt fertil plain
arthur stood aw at the wonder sight
never befor said he in that whisper which we involuntarili us in
the presenc of the dead did i realiz my own insignific
the thought wa abruptli put but the word repres well what wa
pass in hi mind what must pass in the mind of ani man of cultur
and sensibl when he gaze on such a sight for in such presenc
the human mite of todai flutter in the sun and walk on the
earth that these have known and walk four thousand year ago must
inde learn how infinit small is the place that he occupi in the
tale of thing creat and yet if to hi cultur and sensibl he
add religion a word of live hope hover on those dumb lip for
where ar the spirit of those that lie befor him in their etern
silenc answer wither lip and tell us what judgment ha osiri
given and what ha thoth written in hi aw book four thousand
year old human husk if thy dead carcass can last so long what
limit is there to the life of the soul it held
did you collect all these ask arthur when he had made a
superfici examin of the almost countless treasur of the
museum
oh no mr carr spent half hi long life and more monei than i can
tell you in get thi collect togeth it wa the passion of
hi life and he had thi cave hollow at enorm cost becaus he
thought that the air here would be less like to injur them than the
english fog i have ad to it howev i got those papyri and that
beauti bust of berenic the on in black marbl did you ever see
such hair
arthur thought to himself that he had at that moment some not far from
hi heart that must be quit as beauti but he did not sai so
look there ar some curiou thing and she open an airtight
case that contain some discolour grain and a few lump of
shrivel substanc
what ar thei
thi is wheat taken from the insid of a mummi and those ar
suppos to be hyacinth bulb thei came from the mummycas of that
babi princ and i have been told that thei would still grow if
plant
i can scarc believ that the principl of life must be extinct
wise peopl sai you know that the principl of life can never
becom extinct in anyth that ha onc live though it mai chang
it form but i do not pretend to understand these thing howev we
will settl the question for we will plant on and if it grow i
will give the flower to you choos on
arthur took the biggest lump from the case and examin it curious
i have not much faith in your hyacinth i am sure that it is dead
ah but mani thing that seem more dead than that have the strangest
wai of suddenli break into life she said with a littl sigh
give it to me i will have it plant and then with a quick glanc
upward i wonder if you will be here to see it bloom
i dont think that either of us will see it bloom in thi world he
answer laugh and took hi leav
chapter xxxv
had arthur been a littl less wrap up in thought of angela and a
littl more aliv to the fact that be engag or even marri to
on woman doe not necessarili prevent complic aris with
anoth it might have occur to him to doubt the prudenc of the
cours of life that he wa pursu at madeira and as it is it is
imposs to acquit him of show a want of knowledg of the world
amount almost to folli for he should have known upon gener
principl that for a man in hi posit a grizzli bear would have
been a safer daili companion than a young and love widow and the
north pole a more suitabl place of resid than madeira but he
simpli did not think about the matter and as thin ic ha a
treacher wai of not crack till it suddenli break so outward
appear gave him no indic of hi danger
and yet the fact were full of evil promis for as time went on
mildr carr fell headlong in love with him there wa no particular
reason why she should have done so she might have had score of men
handsom clever more distinguish for the ask or rather
for the wait to be ask beyond a certain abil of mind a
take manner and a sympathet thought face with that ting of
melancholi upon it which women sometim find danger interest
there wa noth so remark about arthur that a woman possess
her manifold attract and opportun should unsought and
without inquiri lavish her affect upon him there is onli on
satisfactori explan of the phenomenon which inde is a veri
common on and that is that he wa her fate the on man whom she
wa to love in the world for no woman worth the name ever love
two howev mani she mai happen to marri for thi curiou differ
would appear to exist between the sex the man can attach himself
though in vari degre to sever women in the cours of a
lifetim whilst the woman the true pureheart woman cannot so
adapt her best affect onc given like the law of the mede and
persian it altereth not
mildr felt when her ey first met arthur in donald curri
offic that thi man wa for her differ from all other men though
she did not put the thought in word even to herself and from that
hour till she embark on board the boat he wa continu in her
mind a fact which so irrit her that she nearli miss the steamer
on purpos onli chang her mind at the last moment and then when
she had help him to carri miss terri to her cabin their hand had
accident met and the contact had sent a thrill through her frame
such as she had never felt befor the next develop that she could
trace wa her jealousi of the blackei girl whom she saw him help
about the deck and her consequ rude
up to her present ag mildr carr had never known a singl touch of
love she had not even felt particularli interest in her numer
admir but now thi marbl galatea had by some freak of fate found
a woman heart awkwardli enough without the semblanc of a
supplic on the part of him whom she destin to plai pygmalion
and when she examin herself by the light of the flame thu newli
kindl she shrank back dismai like on who peep over the crater
of a volcano commenc it fieri work she had believ her heart to
be callou to all affect of thi natur it had seem as dead as
the mummi hyacinth and now it wa a live suffer thing and
all alight with love she had tast of a new wine and it burnt her
and wa bitter sweet and yet she long for more and thu by slow
and sad degre she learnt that her life which had for thirti year
flow on it quiet wai unshadow by love wing must henceforth own
hi dominion and be a slave to hi sorrow and capric no wonder
that she grew afraid
but mildr wa a woman of keen insight into charact and it did not
requir that her power of observ should be sharpen by the
condit of her affect to show her that howev deepli she
might be in love with arthur heigham he wa not on littl bit in
love with her know the almost irresist strength of her own
beauti and attract she quickli came to the conclusionand it wa
on that sent a cold chill through herthat there must be some other
woman block the path to hi heart for some reason or other arthur
had never spoken to her of angela either becaus a man veri rare
volunt inform to a woman concern hi exist relationship
with anoth of her sex know that to do so would be to depreci
hi valu in her ey or from an instinct knowledg that the
subject would not be an agreeabl on or perhap becaus the whole
matter wa too sacr to him but she on her part wa determin to
probe hi secret to the bottom so on sleepi afternoon when thei
were sit on the museum verandah about six week after the date of
their arriv in the island she took her opportun
mildr wa sit or rather half ly in a canework chair
gaze out over the peac sea and arthur look at her thought
what a love woman she wa and wonder what it wa that had made
her face and ey so much softer and more attract of late miss
terri wa also there complain of the heat but present she move
off after an imaginari beetl and thei were alon
oh bythebi mr heigham mildr said present i wa go to
ask you a question if onli i can rememb what it is
try to rememb what it is about shoe sealingwax cabbag or

brown ey full upon him and yawn slightli dear me agatha is

oh to be sure the question well it is a veri simpl on who ar

arthur nearli sprang off hi chair with astonish
what make you think that i am engag he ask
she broke into a merri peal of laughter ah if he could have known
what that laugh cost her
what make me think that you ar engag she answer in a tone of
railleri why of cours you would have been at my feet long ago if
it had not been so come dont be retic i shall not laugh at you
what is she like gener a woman first question about a rival
is she as goodlookingwel as i am sayfor though you mai not
think it i have been thought goodlook
she is quit differ from you she is veri tall and fair like an
angel in a pictur you know
oh then there is a she and a she like an angel veri differ
inde from me i should think how nice i caught you out and
she laugh again
why did you want to catch me out said arthur on whose ear mr
carr tone jar he could not tell why
feminin curios and a natur anxieti to fathom the reason of
your sigh that is all but never mind mr heigham you and i shall
not quarrel becaus you ar engag to be marri you shall tell me
the stori when you like for i am sure there is a storyno not thi
afternoon the sun ha given me a headach and i am go to sleep it
off other peopl lovestori ar veri interest to me the more
so becaus i have reach the respect ag of thirti without be
the subject of on myself and again she laugh thi time at her
own falsehood but when he had gone there wa no laughter in her
ey noth but tear bitter burn tear
agatha said mildr that even i am sick of thi place i want
to go to the isl of wight it must be quit nice there now we will
go by the next curri boat
my dear mildr repli miss terri aghast if you were go back
so soon why did you not leav me behind you and just as we were
get so nice settl here too and i shall be so sorri to sai
goodby to that young heigham he is such a nice young man why dont
you marri him i realli thought you like him but perhap he is
come to the isl of wight too oh that dread bai
mildr winc at miss terri allus to arthur of whom that ladi
had grown extrem fond
i am veri sorri dear she said hastili but i am bore to death
and it is such a bad insect year so realli you must begin to pack
up
miss terri began to pack accordingli but when next she allud to
the subject of their departur mildr affect surpris and ask
her what she meant the astonish agatha refer her to her own
word and wa met by a laugh disclaim
why you sure did not think that i wa in earnest did you i wa
onli a littl cross
well realli mildr youv got so strang late that i never know
when you ar in earnest and when you ar not though for my part i
am veri glad to stai in peac and quiet
strang grown strang have i said mr carr look dreamili out
of a window that command the carriagedr with her hand cross
behind her ye i think that you ar right i think that i have lost
the old mildr somewher or other and pick up a new on whom i
dont understand
ah inde remark miss terri in the most matteroffact wai
without have the faintest idea of what her friend wa drive at
how it rain i suppos that he wont come todai
he who he
why how stupid you ar mr heigham of cours
so you alwai mean him when you sai he
ye of cours i do if it isnt ungrammat it is miser thi
afternoon i feel wretch why actual here he come and she
tore off like a schoolgirl into the hall to meet him
ah inde again remark miss terri solemnli to the empti wall
i am not such a fool as i look i suppos that mr heigham wouldnt
come to the isl of wight
it is perhap needless to sai that mr carr had never been more in
earnest in her life than when she announc her intent of depart
to the isl of wight the discoveri that her suspicion about arthur
had but too sure a foundat had been a crush blow to her hope
and she had form a wise resolut to see no more of him happi
would it have been for her if she could have found the moral courag
to act up to it and go awai a wiser if a sadder woman but thi
wa not to be the more she contempl it the more did her passion
which wa now both wild and deeptak hold upon her heart eat
into it like acid into steel and grave on name there in
ineffac letter she could not bear the thought of part from
him and felt or thought she felt that her happi wa alreadi too
deepli pledg to allow her to throw up the card without an effort
fortun favour the brave perhap after all it would declar itself
for her she wa modest in her aspir she did not expect that he
would ever give her the love he bore thi other woman she onli ask
to live in the sunlight of hi presenc and would be glad to take him
at hi own price or inde at ani price man she knew is by natur
as unstabl as water and will mostli melt beneath the ey of more
women than on as readili as ic befor a fire when the sun ha hid
hi face ye she would plai the game out she would not throw awai
her life happi without an effort after all matter might have
been wors he might have been actual marri
but she knew that her hand wa a difficult on to lead from though
she also knew that she held the great trumpsunusu beauti
practic unlimit wealth and consider fascin of manner
her part must be to attract without repel charm without alarm
fascin by slow degre till at length he wa involv in a net
from which there wa no escap and abov all never to allow him to
suspect her motiv till the ripe moment came it wa a hard task for
a proud woman to set herself and in a manner she wa proud but
ala with the best of us when love come in at the door pride
reason and sometim honour fly out the window
and so miss terri heard no more talk of the isl of wight
thenceforward under the frank and open guis of friendship mildr
contriv to keep arthur continu at her side she did more she
drew from him all the histori of hi engag to angela and
listen with word of sympathi on her lip and wrath and bitter
jealousi in her heart to hi enraptur descript of her rival
beauti and perfect so benight wa he inde that onc he went
so far as to suggest that he should when he and angela were marri
come to madeira to spend their honeymoon and dilat on the pleasant
trip which thei three might take togeth
truli thought mildr to herself that would be delight onc
too he even show her a tress of angela hair and strang to sai
she found that there still linger in her bosom a suffici measur
of vulgar first principl to caus her to long to snatch it from him
and throw it into the sea but as it wa she smile faintli and
admir openli and then went to the glass to look at her own nut
brown tress never had she been so dissatisfi with them and yet
her hair wa consid love and an aesthet hairdress had onc
call it a poem
blind fool she mutter stamp her littl foot upon the floor
why doe he tortur me so
mildr forgot that all love is blind and that none wa ever blinder
or more headstrong than her own
and so thi second calypso of a love isl set herself almost as
unblushingli as her prototyp to get our veri unhero ulyss into
her toil and penelop poor penelop she sat at home and span and
defi her wouldb lover
but as yet ulyssesi mean arthurwa consciou of none of those
thing he wa by natur an easygo young gentleman who took
matter as he found them and ask no question and he found them
veri pleasant at madeira or rather at the quinta carr for he did
everyth except sleep there within it precinct he wa everywher
surround with that atmospher of subtl and refin flatteri
flatteri address chiefli to the intellect that is on of the most
effect weapon of a clever woman soon the drawingroom tabl were
load with hi favourit book and no song but such as he approv
were order from london
he discov on even for instanc that mildr look best at
night in black and silver and next morn mr worth receiv a
telegram request him to forward without delai a larg consign
of dress in which those colour predomin
on anoth occas he casual threw out a suggest about the
erect of a terrac in the garden and shortli afterward wa
surpris to find a small armi of portugues labour engag upon
the work he had made thi suggest in total ignor of the
scienc of garden engin and it execut necessit the
remov of vast quantiti of soil and the blast of mani ton of
rock the contractor emploi by mr carr point out how the terrac
could be made equal well at a fifth of the expens but it did not
happen to take exactli the direct that arthur had indic so she
would have none of it hi word wa law and becaus he had spoken
the whole place wa for a month overrun with dirti labour whilst
to the great detriment of miss terri remain nerv and even to
the slight discomfort of hi royal high himself the air resound
all dai long with the terrif bang of the blast powder
but so long as he wa pleas with the progress of the improv
mildr felt no discomfort nor would she allow ani on els to
express ani it even aggrav her to see miss terri put her hand to
her head and jump whenev a particularli larg piec of ordnanc wa
discharg and she would vow that it must be affect becaus she
never even notic it
in short mildr carr possess to an extraordinari degre that
faculti for blind unreason ador which is so characterist of
the sex an ador that is at onc magnific in the entireti of
it own selfsacrific and extrem selfish when she thought that
she could pleas arthur the state of agatha nerv becam a matter
of suprem indiffer to her and in the same wai had she been an
absolut monarch she would have spent the live of thousand and
shaken empir till throne came tumbl down like appl in the
wind if she had believ that she could therebi advanc herself in
hi affect
but as it never occur to arthur that mr carr might be in love
with him he saw noth abnorm about all thi not that he wa
conceit for nobodi wa ever less so but it is wonder what an
amount of flatteri and attent men will accept from women as their
simpl right if the other sex possess the faculti of admir we
in compens ar perfectli endow with that of receiv it with
careless eas and when we fall in with some goddess who is foolish
enough to worship us and to whom we should be on our knee we
mere label her sympathet and sai that she understand us
from all of which wise reflect the reader will gather that our
friend arthur wa not a hundr mile off an awkward situat
chapter xxxvi
on dai some three week after arthur had gone angela stroll down
the tunnel walk now in the height of summer almost dark with the
shade of the limetre and settl herself on on of the stone seat
under caresfoot staff
she had a book in hand but it soon becam clear that she had come to
thi seclud spot to think rather than read for it fell unopen
from her hand and her grei ey were full of a faroff look as thei
gaze across the lake glitter in the sunlight awai toward the
hazi purpl outlin of the distant hill her face wa quit calm but
it wa not that of a happi person inde it gave a distinct idea of
mental suffer all grief howev acut is subject to fix
gradat and angela wa yet in the second stage first there is the
acut stage when the heart ach with a physic pain and the mind
fill with a wild yearn or tortur by an unceas anxieti well
nigh give beneath the abnorm strain thi doe not last long or it
would kill or drive us to the madhous then come that long epoch of
dull miseri endur till at last kindli natur in piti rub off the
rough extrem of our calam and by slow but sure degre soften
agoni into sorrow
thi wa what she wa now pass through anda all highli
organ natur like her own ar especi in youth veri
sensit to those more exquisit vibrat of pain and happi
that leav mind of a coarser fibr compar unmovedit mai be
taken for grant that she wa suffer suffici acut
perhap she had never quit realiz how necessari arthur had becom
to her how deep hi love had sent it fibr into her heart and inner
self until he wa violent wrench awai from her and she lost all
sight and knowledg of him in the dark of the outsid world still
she had made no show of her sorrow but onc when pigott told her
some pathet stori of the death of a littl child in the villag she
burst into a paroxysm of weep the piti for anoth pain had
loos the floodgat of her own but it wa a perform that she
did not repeat
but angela had her anxieti as well as her grief and it wa over
these former that she wa think as she sat on the great stone under
the oak love is a wonder quicken of the percept and
ignor as she wa of all the world wai the more she thought over
the term impos by her father upon her engag the more
distrust did she grow ladi bellami too had been to see her
twice and on each occas had inspir her with a live sens of
fear and repugn dure the first of these visit she had shown a
perfect acquaint with the circumst of her engag her
flirtat with mr heigham as she wa pleas to call it dure
the second call too she had been full of strang remark about her
cousin georg talk mysteri of a chang that had come over
him sinc hi ill and of hi be under a new influenc nor
wa thi all for on the veri next dai when she wa out walk with
pigott in the villag she had met georg himself and he had insist
upon enter into a long rambl convers with her and on
look at her in a wai that made her feel perfectli sick
oh aleck she said aloud to the dog that wa sit by her side
with hi head upon her knee for he wa now her constant companion i
wonder where your master is your master and mine aleck would to god
that he were back here to protect me for i am grow afraid i dont
know of what aleck and there ar eleven long silent month to wait
at thi moment the dog rais hi head listen and sprang round
with an angri woof angela rose up with a flash of hope in her ey
turn and face georg caresfoot
he wa still pale and shrivel from the effect of hi ill but
otherwis littl chang except that the lightblu ey glitter
with a fierc determin and that the featur had attain that
fixiti and strength which sometim come to those who ar bent heart
and soul upon an enterpris be it good or evil
so i have found you out at last cousin angela what ar you not
go to shake hand with me
angela touch hi finger with her own
my father is not here she said

see him again do you
if we both live i shall certainli see him again inde i shall in
ani case
you will never see him again
why not
becaus he wa onli flirt and plai the fool with you he is a
notori flirt and to my certain knowledg ha been engag to two
women befor
i do not believ that that is true or if it is true it is not all
the truth but true or untru i am not go to discuss mr heigham
with you or allow myself to be influenc by stori told behind hi
back
angela said georg rise and seiz her hand
she turn quit pale and a shudder pass over her frame
leav my hand alon and never dare to touch me again thi is the
second time that you have tri to insult me
so answer georg furiou with outrag pride and baffl
passion you set up your will against mine do you veri well you
shall see i will crush you to powder insult you inde how often
did that young blackguard insult you i warrant he did more than take
your hand
if answer angela you mean mr heigham i shall leav you to
consid whether that term is not more applic to the person who
doe hi best to outrag an unprotect woman and take advantag of
the absent than to the gentleman against whom you have us it and
dart on him on glanc of suprem contempt she swept awai like an
angri queen
left to hi medit georg shook hi fist toward where she had
vanish
veri well my fine ladi veri well he said aloud you treat me as
so much dirt do you you shall smart for thi so sure as my name is
georg caresfoot onli wait till you ar in my power and you shall
learn that i wa never yet defi with impun oh and you shall
learn mani other thing also
from that time forward angela wa for a period of two month or
more subject to an organ persecut as harass as it wa
cruel georg waylaid her everywher and twice actual succeed in
enter into convers with her but on both occas she manag
to escap from him befor he could proce ani further so
persist did he hunt her that at last the wretch girl wa
driven to hide herself awai in odd corner of the hous and wood in
order to keep out of hi wai then he took to write her letter and
send handsom present all of which she return
poor angela it wa hard both to lose her lover and to suffer daili
from the persecut of her hate cousin which were now push
forward so openli and with such pertinac as to fill her with vagu
alarm what made her posit wors wa that she had no on in whom
to confid for mr fraser had not yet return pigott inde knew
more or less what wa go on but she could do noth except
bewail arthur absenc and tell her not to mind there remain
her father but with him she had never been on suffici intim
term for confid inde as time went on the suspicion gather
strength in her mind that he wa privi to georg advanc and that
those advanc had someth to do with the harsh term impos upon
arthur and herself but at last matter grew so bad that have no
other refug she determin to appeal to him for protect
father she said boldli on dai to philip as he wa sit
write in hi studi my cousin georg is persecut me everi dai i
have born it as long as i can but i can bear it no longer i have
come to ask you to protect me from him
why angela i should have thought that you were perfectli capabl of
protect yourself what is he persecut you about what doe he
want
to marri me i suppos answer angela blush to her ey
well that is a veri complimentari wish on hi part and i can tell
you what it is angela if onli you could get that young heigham out
of your head you might do a deal wors
it is quit useless to talk to me like that she answer coldli
well that is your affair but it is veri ridicul of you to come
and ask me to protect you the woman must inde be a fool who
cannot protect herself
and so the interview end
next dai ladi bellami call again
my dear child she said to angela you ar not look well thi
busi worri you no doubt it is the old struggl between duti
and inclin that we have most of us gone through well there is
on consol nobodi who ever did hi or her duti regardless of
inclin ever regret it in the end
what do you mean ladi bellami when you talk about my duti
i mean the plain duti that li befor you of marri your cousin
georg and of throw up thi young heigham
i recogn no such duti
my dear angela do look at the matter from a sensibl point of view
think what a good thing it would be for your father and rememb
too that it would reunit all the properti if ever a girl had a
clear duti to perform you have
sinc you insist so much upon my duti i must sai that it seem to
me that an honest girl in my posit ha three duti to consid
and not on as you sai ladi bellami first there is her duti to the
man she love for her the greatest duti of ani in the world next her
duti to herself for her happi and selfrespect ar involv in
her decis and lastli her duti to her famili i put the famili
last becaus after all it is she who get marri not her famili
ladi bellami smile a littl
you argu well but there is on thing that you overlook though i am
sorri to have to pain you by sai it young mr heigham is no better
than he should be i have made inquiri about him and think that i
ought to tell you that
what do you mean
i mean that hi life young as he is ha not been so credit as
it might have been he ha been the hero of on or two littl affair
i can tell you about them if you like
ladi bellami your stori ar either true or untru if true i
should take no notic of them becaus thei must have happen befor
he love me if untru thei would be a mere wast of breath so i
think that we mai dispens with the storiesthei would influenc me
no more than the hum of next summer gnat
ladi bellami smile again
you ar a curiou woman she said but suppos that there were
to be a repetit of these littl stori after he love you what
would you sai then
angela look troubl and thought awhil
he could never go far from me she answer
what do you mean
i mean that i hold the string of hi heart in my hand and i have
onli to lift them to draw him back to meso no other woman no
live forc can keep him from me if i choos to bid him come
suppos that to be so how about the selfrespect you spoke of just
now could you bear to take your lover back from the hand of anoth
woman
that would entir depend upon the circumst and upon what wa
just to the other woman
you would not then throw him up without question
ladi bellami i mai be veri ignor and simpl but i am neither mad
nor a fool what do you suppos that my life would be worth to me if i
threw arthur up if i remain singl it would be an ach void as
it is now and if i marri ani other man whilst he still live it
would becom a daili and shame humili such as i had rather die
than endur
ladi bellami glanc up from under her heavylid ey a thought
had evid struck her but she did not express it
then i am to tell your cousin georg that you will have absolut
noth to do with him
ye and beg him to ceas persecut me it is quit useless if
there were no arthur and no other man in the world i would not marri
him i detest himi cannot tell you how i detest him
it is amus to hear you talk so and to think that you will
certainli be mr georg caresfoot within nine month
never answer angela passion stamp her foot upon the
floor what make you sai such horribl thing
i reflect answer ladi bellami with an omin smile that
georg caresfoot ha made up hi mind to marri you and that i have
made up mine to help him to do so and that your will strong as it
certainli is is as compar with our unit will what a straw is
to a gale the straw cannot travel against the wind it must go with
it and you must marri georg caresfoot you will as certainli come
to the altarrail with him as you will to your deathb it is
written in your face goodby
for the first time angela courag realli gave wai as she heard these
dread word she rememb how she herself had call ladi bellami
an embodi of the spirit of power and now she felt that the
comparison wa just the woman wa power incarn and her word
which from anybodi els she would have laugh at sent a cold chill
through her
she is a fine creatur both in mind and bodi reflect ladi
bellami as she step into her carriag realli though i try to
hate her i can find it in my heart to be sorri for her inde i am
not sure that i do not like her certainli i respect her but she ha
come in my path and must be crushedmi own safeti demand it at
least she is worth crush and the game is fair for perhap she
will crush me i should not be surpris there is a judgment in those
grei ey of hersqui vivra verra home william
chapter xxxvii
angela appeal for protect set philip think
as the reader is awar hi sole motiv in consent to becom as it
were a sleep partner in the shame plot of which hi innoc
daughter wa the object wa to obtain possess of hi lost
inherit and it now occur to him that even should that plot
succe which he veri greatli doubt noth had as yet been
settl as to the term upon which it wa to be reconvei to him the
whole affair wa excess repugn to him inde he regard the
prospect of it success with littl less than terror onli hi greed
overmast hi fear
but on on point he wa veri clear it should not succe except upon
the veri best of term for himself hi daughter should not be
sacrif unless the price paid for the victim wa posit
princ such guilt wa not to be incur for a bagatel if georg
marri angela the isleworth estat must pass back into hi hand
for a veri low sum inde but would hi cousin be will to accept
such a sum that wa the rub and that too wa what must be made
clear without ani further delai he had no wish to see angela put to
needless suffer suffer which would not bring an equival with
it and which might on the contrari entail consequ upon himself
that he shudder to think of
curious enough howev he had of late been signal free from hi
superstiti fear inde sinc the night when he had so astonish
arthur by hi outbreak about the shadow on the wall no fit had come
to troubl him and he wa begin to look upon the whole thing as
an evil dream a nightmar that he had at last live down but still
the nightmar might return and he wa not go to run the risk
unless he wa veri well paid for it and so he determin to offer a
price so low for the properti that no man in hi sens would accept
it and then wrote a note to georg ask him to come over on the
follow even after dinner as he wish to speak to him on a
matter of busi
there he said to himself that will make an end of the affair and
i will get young heigham back and thei can be marri georg can
never take what i mean to offer if he should the egyptian will be
spoil inde and the game will be worth the candl not that i have
ani respons about it howev i shall put no pressur on
angela she must choos for herself and philip went to bed quit
feel as though he had done a virtuou action
georg came punctual enough on the follow even which wa that

well as i intim to ladi bellami i do not at all approv of your
suit angela is alreadi subject to my consent veri suitabl engag
to your late ward a young fellow whom whatev you mai think about
him i like veri much and i can assur you that it will requir the
veri strongest induc to make me even allow such a thing in ani

perfectli free agent
which mean i suppos that you intend to screw down the price
in want to marri angela went on philip you must rememb that
you fly high she is a veri love woman and what is more will some
dai or other be exceedingli well off whilst youyou must excus me

consent provid that befor the marriag you consent to give me
clear transfer at a price of all the isleworth estat with the
except of the mansion and the pleasureground
veri good but now about the price that is the real point
thei had taken a path that ran down through the shrubberi to the
side of the lake and then turn up toward caresfoot staff befor
answer georg remark philip propos that thei should sit down
and suit the action to the word place himself upon the trunk of
a fallen tree that lai by the water edg just outsid the spread of
the branch of the great oak and command a view of the area
beneath them
the moon will come out again present he said when georg had
follow hi exampl she ha got behind that thundercloud ah as

inclus of timber and with all improvementsjust as it stand in
short

georg sprang from hi seat and sat down again befor he answer

such a ridicul offer why the probat valuat wa two hundr
thousand and that wa veri low
i offer on hundr thousand and am will to settl thirti

give me a minut to think and georg hid hi face in hi hand and
philip look at him with hatr gleam in hi dark ey mutter
between hi teeth
i believ that my turn ha come at last
when some thirti second had pass in silenc the attent of the
pair wa attract by the crack of dead leav that sound quit
startl in the intens still of the night and next second a
tall figur in white glide up to the water edg and stood still
within half a dozen pace of them
involuntarili philip grip hi cousin arm but neither of them
move the sky had rapidli cloud up and the faint light that
struggl from the moon onli serv to show that the figur appear

thei were not left long in doubt for at that instant a vivid flash
from the thundercloud turn the dark into the most brilliant
dai and reveal a woman stand up to her knee in the water with
her arm lift knot her long hair it wa angela for on moment
the fierc light shone upon the state form that gleam whiter than
ivorywhit as snow against the dens background of the brushwood
and as it pass thei heard her sink into the water softli as a
swan and strike out with steadi stroke toward the centr of the
lake
it is onli angela said philip when the sound of the stroke grew
faint phew what a state she gave me

chapter xxxviii
georg had spoken no falsehood when he said that he felt as though he
must marri angela or go mad inde it is a strike proof of how
necessari he thought that step to be to hi happi that he had
been will to consent to hi cousin shylocklik term about the
sale of the properti although thei would in their result degrad him
from hi posit as a larg land proprietor and make a
compar poor man of him the danger or suffer that could
induc a caresfoot to half ruin himself with hi ey open had need to
be of an extraordinarili press natur
love empir is thi globe and all mankind the most refin and the
most degrad the cleverest and the most stupid ar all liabl to
becom hi faith subject he can alik command the devot of an
archbishop and a southsea island of the most immacul maiden
ladi whatev her ag and of the savag zulu girl from the pole to
the equat and from the equat to the further pole there is no
monarch like love where he set hi foot the rock bloom with
flower or the garden becom a wilder accord to hi good
will and pleasur and at hi whisper all other allegi melt awai
like rope of mud he is the real arbit of the destini of the
world
but to each natur of all the million beneath hi swai love come in
a fit guis to some as an angel messeng tell of sympathi
and peac and a strang new hope to other drape in sad robe
inde but still divin thu when he visit such a on as georg
caresfoot it is as a potent fiend whose mission is to enter through
man lower natur to tortur and destroi to scorch the heart with
fear heat and then to crush it and leav it owner bosom
choke with bitter dust
and so far as georg is concern there is no doubt but what the
work wa done right well for under the influenc of what is with
doubt proprieti known as the tender passion that estim
charact wa rapidli drift within a measur distanc of a
lunat asylum the check and repuls that he had met with instead
of cool hi ardour had onli the effect of inflam it to an
extraordinari degre angela scorn dislik as water thrown upon
burn oil did but diffus the flame of hi passion throughout the
whole system of hi mind till he grew wild with it heat and
violenc her gloriou beauti daili took a still stronger hold upon
hi imagin till it scorch into hi veri soul for whole night
he could not sleep for whole dai he would scarc eat or do
anyth but walk walk walk and try to devis mean to win her to
hi side the irrit of the mind produc it natur effect upon
hi conduct and he would burst into fit of the most causeless furi
in on of these he dismiss everi servant in the hous and so evil
wa hi reput among that class that he had great difficulti in
obtain other to take their place in anoth he hurl a heavi pot
contain an azaleabush at the head of on of the garden and had
to compromis an action for assault in short the lunat asylum
loom veri near inde
for a week or so after the memor night of hi interview with
philip an interview that he at least would never forget georg wa
quit unabl try as he would to get a singl word with angela
at last on dai when he wa drive by a seldomus road past the
field near the abbei hous on hi wai from roxham chanc gave him
the opportun that he had for so long sought without success for
far up a bylan that led to a turnipfield hi ey caught sight of
the flutter of a grei dress vanish round a corner someth in the
make of which suggest to him that angela wa it wearer give the
rein to the servant and bid him drive on home he got out of the
dogcart and hurri up the grassi track and on turn the corner
came suddenli upon the object of hi search she wa stand on the
bank of the hedgerow and struggl with a bough of honeysuckl from
which she wish to pluck it last remain autumn bloom so engag

voic grate on her ear that she knew that she wa trap
caught at last you have given me a pretti hunt angela
the violent start she gave effectu carri out her purpos as

backward jerk and she turn round upon him pant with fear and
exert the floweri bough grasp within her hand

you would not treat me so i tell you that i am in tortur and the
muscl of the pallid face twitch in a wai that went far to confirm
hi word
i do not understand your mean unless inde you ar try to

georg with a sudden chang of manner from the confid to the
supplicatori look i beg you not to on my knee and he actual
flung himself down on the grass roadwai and grovel befor her in an
abandon of passion hideou to behold
she turn veri pale and answer him in a cold quiet voic everi
syllabl of which fell upon him like the stroke of a knife
such a thing would be quit imposs for mani reason but i need
onli repeat you on that you ar alreadi awar of i am engag to mr

dress he is not rich he ha onli got enough for a bare live i
have five time the monei and you shall help to spend it dont marri
a young beggar like that you wont get valu for yourself it will
pai you ever so much better to marri me
georg wa convinc from hi experi of the sex that everi woman
could be bought if onli you bid high enough but as the sequel
show he could not well have us a wors argument to a person like
angela or on more like to excit the indign that fear of him
togeth with a certain respect for the evid genuin of hi
suffer had hitherto kept in suppress she wrench her dress
free from him leav a portion of it fabric in hi hand

to be my father i tell you that my love is alreadi given which would
have been a suffici answer to ani gentleman and you repli by

drawn up the full height of her majest statur her face flush
with emot and her clear ey flash scorn fire whilst in her
hand she still held the bough of sweet honeysuckl angela form a
strang contrast to the miser man crouch at her feet swai
himself to and fro and moan hi hat off and hi face hidden in hi

for angela to have so much of the societi of an illeduc and not

her
she ha been with me for twenti year and my daughter is devot to
her i cant turn her off
it is alwai pain to dismiss an old servantalmost as bad as

thrown awai sure the same appli to servant

i can quit understand your feel but then you see an agreement
impli oblig on both side doesnt it especi an agreement

nobodi know what the morrow mai bring forth
where you and my amiabl cousin ar concern i shall be much

as he heard the front door close i suppos that it must be done
about pigott curs that woman with her sorceress face i wish i had
never put myself into her power the iron hand can be felt pretti
plainli through her velvet glove
life is never altogeth cloud over and that morn angela
horizon had been brighten by two big rai of sunshin that came to
shed their cheer light on the grei monotoni of her surround
for of late notwithstand it occasion spasm of fierc
excit her life had been as monoton as it wa miser
alwai the same anxiou grief the same fear the same long
press hourli round her like phantom in the mistno not like
phantom like real live thing peep at her from the dark
sometim inde the presenti and intang terror that were
gradual strengthen their hold upon her would get beyond her
control and arous in her a restless desir for actionani action
it did not matter whatthat would take her awai out of these dull
hour of unwholesom mental growth it wa thi long to be do
someth that drove her fever physic with the stifl air of
the summer night and mental by thought of her absent lover and
recollect of ladi bellami omin word down to the border of
the lake on the even of georg visit to her father and onc
there prompt her to try to forget her troubl for awhil in the
exercis of an art of which she had from childhood been a mistress
the same feel it wa too that led her to spend long hour of the
dai and even of the night when by right she should have been asleep
immers in endless mathemat studi and in solv or
attempt to solv almost imposs problem she found that the
strenuou effort of the brain act as a counterirrit to the
fret of her troubl and though it mai seem an odd thing to sai
mathemat alon ow to the intens applic thei requir
exercis a sooth effect upon her but as on cannot constantli
sleep induc by chloral without pai for it in some shape or form
angela relief from her care wa obtain at no small cost to her
health when the same brain howev well develop it mai be ha
both to studi hard and suffer much there must be a wast of tissu
somewher in angela case the outward and visibl result of thi
state of thing wa to make her grow thinner and the altern mental
effect to increasingli rarefi an intellect alreadi too ether for
thi workadai world and to plung it owner into fit of depress
which were render dread by sudden forebod of evil that would
leap to life in the recess of her mind and for a moment cast a
lurid glare upon it gloom such as at night the lightn give to
the black which surround it
it wa in on of the worst of these fit her cloudi dai as she
would call them to pigott that good new found her as she wa

oh i am glad why could you not tell me befor cousin georg
dispos of and mr fraser come back why thing ar look quit
bright again at least thei would be if onli arthur were here and
her rejoic end in a sigh
as soon as she thought that he would have finish hi beefsteak with
or without the onion angela walk down to the vicarag and broke in
upon mr fraser with someth of her old gladsom warmth run up
to him without wait to be announc she seiz him by both hand
and so you ar back at last what a long time you have been awai oh
i am so glad to see you
mr fraser who it struck her look older sinc hi absenc turn
first a littl red and then a littl pale and said
ye angela here i am back again in the old shop it is veri good of
you to come so soon to see me now sit down and tell me all about
yourself whilst i go on with my unpack but bless me my dear
what is the matter with you you look thin and as though you were not
happi andwher ha your smile gone to angela
never mind me you must tell me all about yourself first where have
you been and what have you been do all these long month
oh i have been enjoi myself over half the civil globe he
answer with a somewhat forc laugh switzerland itali and spain
have all been benefit by my presenc but i got tire of it so here
i am back in my proper sphere and delight to again behold these
dear familiar face and he point to hi ampl collect of
classic but let me hear about yourself angela i am tire of
no 1 i can assur you
oh mine is a long stori you will scarc find patienc to listen
to it
ah i thought that there wa a stori from your face then i think
that i can guess what it is about young ladi stori gener
turn upon the same pivot and he laugh a littl softli and sat
down in a corner well out of the light now my dear i am readi to
give you my best attent
angela blush veri deepli and look studious out of the window
began with mani hesit to tell her stori
well mr fraser you must understand first of alli mean you know
that i must tell you that desper that i am engag
ah
there wa a someth so sharp and sudden about thi exclam that
angela turn round quickli
what the matter have you hurt yourself
ye but go on angela
it wa an awkward stori to tell especi the georg complic
part of it and to ani on els she felt that she would have found it
almost imposs to tell it but in mr fraser she wa she knew
sure of a sympathet listen had she known too that the mere
mention of her lover name wa a stab to her listen heart and
that everi express of her own deep and endur love and each tone
of endear were new and ingeni tortur she might well have
been confus
for so it wa although he wa fifti year of ag mr fraser had not
educ angela with impun he had paid the penalti that must have
result to ani heartwhol man not absolut a fossil who had been
brought into close contact with such a woman as angela her loveli
appeal to hi sens of beauti her good to hi heart and her
learn to hi intellectu sympathi what wonder that he learnt by
impercept degre to love her the wonder would have been if he
had not
the reader need not fear howev he shall not be troubl with ani
long account of mr fraser misfortun for it never came to light or
obtrud itself upon the world or even upon it object hi wa on of
those earnest secret and selfsacrif passion of which if we
onli knew it there exist a good mani round about us passion which
to all appear tend to noth and ar entir without object
unless it to be make the individu on whom thei ar inflict a
littl less happi or a littl more miser as the case mai be
than he or she would otherwis have been it wa to strive to conquer
thi passion which in hi heart he call dishonour that mr
fraser had gone abroad right awai from angela where he had wrestl
with it and prai against it and at last as he thought subdu
it but now on hi first sight of her it rose again in all it
former strength and rush through hi be like a storm and he
realiz that such love is of those thing that cannot die and
perhap it is a question if he realli wish to lose it it wa a poor
thing inde a veri poor thing but hi own there is someth so
divin about all true love that there lurk a convict at the bottom
of the heart of most of us that it is better to love howev much we
suffer than not to love at all perhap after all those realli to
be piti ar the peopl who ar not capabl of ani such sensat
but what mr fraser suffer listen that autumn afternoon to
angela tale of anoth love and of her own deep return of that
love no man but himself ever knew yet still he heard and wa not
shaken in hi loyalhearted and comfort and consol her
give her the best advic in hi power like the nobl christian
gentleman that he wa show her too that there wa littl need of
anxieti and everi ground for hope that thing would come to a happi
and success issu the martyr abneg of self is not yet dead
in the world
at last angela came to the letter that she had that veri morn
receiv from georg mr fraser read it carefulli
at ani rate he said he is behav like a gentleman now on the
whole that is a nice letter you will be troubl with him no more
ye answer angela and then flush up at the memori of georg
argument in the lane but it is certainli time that he did for he
had no busi oh he had no busi to speak to me as he spoke
and he a man old enough to be my father
mr fraser pale cheek colour a littl
dont be hard upon him becaus he is old angelawhich by the wai he
is not he is nearli ten year my juniorfor i fear that old men ar
just as liabl to be made fool of by a pretti face as young on
from that moment not know the man real charact mr fraser
secretli entertain a certain sympathi for georg suffer
aris no doubt from a fellowfeel it seem to him that he could
understand a man go veri far inde when hi object wa to win
angela not that he would have done it himself but he knew the
temptat and what it cost to struggl against it
it wa nearli dark when at length angela rise to go warmli press
hi hand and thank him in her own sweet wai for hi good and
kind counsel and then declin hi offer of escort and sai that
she would come and see him again on the morrow she depart on her
homeward path
the first thing that met her gaze on the halltabl at the abbei hous
wa a note address to herself in a handwrit that she had seen in
mani wash bill but never befor on an envelop she open it in
vagu alarm it ran as follow
missyor father ha just dismiss me sai that he is too
pore to keep me ani longer which is a matter as i hold my own
opinion on and that i am too unedd to be in yore compani
which is a perfect truth but miss not feel ani how ekal to
bid you goodby in person after bring you up by hand and do
for you these mani year i take the liberti to write to you
miss to sai goodby and god bless you my beauti angel and i
shall be to be found down at the old housen at the end of the
drift as my pore husband left me which is fortin just empti
and prap you will come and see me at time miss

nightshift in the left hand drawyer and sorri am i that i cant
be there to lai it out for you i shall take the liberti to send

angela read the letter through and then sank back upon a chair and
burst into a storm of tear partial recov herself howev
she rose and enter her father studi
is thi true she ask still sob
is what true ask philip indiffer and affect not to see
her distress
that you have sent pigott awai

excus her ey were quit dry now that woman nurs my dy

she left the room
philip quail befor hi daughter anger
thank good she gone and that job is done with i am downright
afraid of her and the worst of it is she speak the truth said
philip to himself as the door close
ten dai after thi incid angela heard casual from mr fraser
that sir john and ladi bellami were go on a short trip abroad for
the benefit of the former health if she thought about the matter at
all it wa to feel rather glad angela did not like ladi bellami
inde she fear her of georg she neither heard nor saw anyth
he had also gone awai
chapter xli
meanwhil at madeira matter were go on much as we left them there
had inde been littl appreci chang in the situat
for hi part our friend arthur continu to danc or rather stroll
along the edg of hi floweri precipic and found the view pleasant
and the air brace
and no doubt thing were veri nice arrang for hi satisfact
and had it not been for the everpres thought of angelafor he did
think of her a great deal and with deep longingh should have
enjoi himself thoroughli for everi dai wa beauti and everi dai
brought it amus with it perhap on arriv at the quinta carr
about eleven oclock he would find that the steam launch wa wait
for them in a littl bai where the cliff on which the hous stood
curv inward then a merri parti of young english folk all
collect togeth by mr carr that morn by the dint of superhuman
effort thei would scrambl down the step cut in the rock and steam
off to some neighbour islet to eat luncheon and wander about
collect shell and flower and beetl till sunset and then steam
back again through the spici even air laugh and flirt and
make the night melodi with their song or els the hors would
be order out and thei would wander over the lone mountain in the
interior of the island talk of mummi and all thing human of
angela and all thing divin and sometim in the cours of these
convers arthur would in a brotherli wai call mr carr
mildr while occasion in the tone of a spinster aunt she
would address him as arthur a practic that onc acquir she
soon found wa like all other bad habit not easi to get rid of for
somehow in all these expedit she wa continu at hi side
strive and not without success to weav herself into the substanc
of hi life and to make herself indispens to him till at last he
grew to look upon her almost as a sister
but beyond thi he never went and to her advanc he wa as cold as
ic simpli becaus he never notic them and she wa afraid of
make them more obviou for fear that she would frighten him awai he
thought it the most natur thing in the world that he and mildr
should live togeth like brother and sister and be veri fond of each
other as sich whilst she thought himjust what he wasth
blindest of fool and then love him the more for hi folli the
sisterli relationship did not possess the same charm for mildr that
it did for arthur thei look at matter from differ point of
view
on morn peep through a big telescop that wa fix in the
window of the littl boudoir which form an entranc lobbi to the
museum mr carr saw a cloud of smoke upon the horizon present the
point of a mast poke up through the vapour as though the vessel were
rise out of the ocean then two more masthead and a red and black
funnel and last of all a great grei hull

telescop and the remaind of her littl face all screw up in her
effort to keep the other close it the mail i can see the donald

separ
when after lunch and see round the ship miss terri and arthur
found themselv in the steam launch wait for mr carr who wa
sai goodbi to the captain and look after her preciou box
arthur took the opportun to ask hi companion what she knew of lord
minster
oh not much that is noth in particular except that he is the
son of a sugarbrok or someth who wa made a peer for some
reason or other and i suppos that is why he is so stuck up becaus
all the other peer i ever met ar just like other peopl he is veri
clever too is in the govern now and alwai hang about after
mildr he want to marri her you know and i expect that he will at
last but i hope he wont i dont like him he alwai look at on as
though on were dirt
the deuc he doe ejacul arthur hi heart fill on the
instant with envi hatr malic and all uncharit toward
lord minster he had not the slightest wish to marri mildr himself
but he boil at the mere thought of anybodi els do so ladi
florenc wa right there is a differ between ladi and
landscap
at that moment mildr herself arriv but so disgust wa he that
he would scarc speak to her and on arriv at the land stage
he at onc depart to the hotel and even tri to get out of come
to dinner that night but thi wa overrul
good said mildr to herself with a smile i have found out how
to vex him
at dinner that even lord minster who had of cours taken hi
hostess in open the convers by ask her how she had been
emploi herself at madeira
better than you have at st stephen lord minster at ani rate i
have not been forward scheme for highwai robberi and the nation
disgrac she answer laugh
i suppos that you mean the irish land act and the transvaal
convent i have heard sever ladi speak of them like that and i
am realli come to the conclus that your sex is entir devoid of
polit instinct
what do you mean by polit instinct lord minster ask arthur
by polit instinct he repli i understand a proper
appreci of the scienc and object of govern
good me what ar thei ask mr carr
well the scienc of govern consist roughli speak in
know how to get into offic and remain there when onc in it
object ar to guess and give express to the prevail popular
feel or whim with the loss of as few vote as possibl
accord to that definit said arthur all nation question
ar or should be treat by those who understand the scienc and
object of govern on a semifinanci basi i mean thei should
be dealt with as an investor deal with hi fund in order to make as
much out of them as possibl not to bring real benefit to the
countri
you put the matter rather awkwardli but i think i follow you i will
try to explain in the first place all the oldfashion jingo
nonsens about patriot and the honour of the countri ha if
peopl onli knew it quit explod it onli linger in a certain
section of the land gentri and a proport of the upper middl
class and ha no seriou weight with lead politician
how about lord beaconsfield
well he wa perhap an except but then he wa a man with so
larg a mindi sai it though i detest himthat he could actual
by a sort of polit prescienc see into the far futur and shape
hi cours accordingli but even in hi case i do not believ that he
wa actuat by patriot but rather by a keener insight into human
affair than most men possess
and yet he came terribl to grief
becaus he outflew hi ag the will of the countrywhich mean the
will of between five hundr thousand and a million hungri fluctuat
electorscould not wait for the develop of hi imperi scheme
thei want plunder in the present not honour and prosper for the
empir in the futur the instinct of robberi is perhap the strongest
in human natur and those who would rule human on it present
basi must pander to it or fail the parti of progress mean the parti
that can give most spoil taken from those that have to those that
have not that is why mr gladston is such a truli great man he
understand better than ani on of hi ag how to excit the greed of
hungri voter and to guid it for hi own end what wa the
midlothian campaign but a crusad of plunder first he excit the
desir then he promis to satisfi it of cours that is imposs
but at the time he wa believ and hi promis float us
triumphantli into power the same argument appli to that bodi of
elector whose motiv power is sentimenttheir folli must be pander
to for instanc the transvaal convent that mr carr mention is
an admir exampl of how such pander is done no man of
experi can have believ that such an agreement could be wise or
that it can result in anyth but troubl and humili but the
troubl and humili will not come just yet and in the meanwhil a
sop is thrown to cerberu polit memori ar short and when
exposur come it will be easi to fix the blame upon the other side
it is becaus we appreci these fact that in the end we must
prevail the liber parti or rather the radic section which is to
the great liber parti what the helm is to the ship appeal to the
baser instinct and more press appetit of the peopl the
conserv onli to their tradit and higher aspir in the
same wai that religion appeal to the spirit and the worship of
mammon to the sens the shibboleth of the on is selfinterest of
the other nation honour the first appeal to the mani the
second to the finer few and i must leav you to judg which will
carri the dai
and if ever you becom prime minist shall you rule england upon
these principl ask mr carr
certainli it is becaus i have master them that i am what i am i
ow everyth to them consequ in my view thei ar the finest of
all principl
then heaven help england soliloqu arthur rude
and so sai we all ad ladi florenc who wa a strong
conserv
my dear young peopl answer lord minster with a superior smile
england is quit capabl of look after herself i have to look
after myself she will at ani rate last my time and my motto is
that on should get someth out of on countri not attempt to do
her servic that would in all probabl never be recogn or if
recogn left unreward
arthur wa about to answer with more sharp than discret but
mr carr interpos
well lord minster we have to thank you for a veri cynic and lucid
explan of the object of your parti if thei realli ar it
object will you give me some wine
after dinner mr carr devot herself almost exclus to lord
minster leav arthur to talk to ladi florenc lord minster wa not
slow to avail himself of the opportun
i have been think of your remark to me in london about the
crossingsweep he began
oh for heaven sake dont drag that wretch man out of hi grave
lord minster i realli have forgotten what i said about him
i hope mr carr that you have forgotten a good deal you said that
dai i mai as well take thi opportun
no pleas dont lord minster she answer know veri well what
wa come i am so tire tonight
oh in that case i can easili postpon my statement i have a whole
fortnight befor me
mr carr secretli determin that it should remain as much as
possibl at hi own exclus dispos but she did not sai so
shortli after thi arthur took hi leav after shake hand veri
coldli with her nor did he come to the quinta next dai as he had
conceiv too great a detest of lord minster to risk meet him
a detest which he attribut sole to that rise member of the
govern polit principl which jar veri much with hi
own
better and better said mr carr to herself as she took off her
dress but lord minster is realli odiou i cannot stand him for
long
chapter xlii
why arthur i had almost forgotten what you ar like said mildr
when that young gentleman at last put in an appear at the quinta
where have you been to all thi time
ioh i have been write letter said arthur
then thei must have been veri long on dont tell fib arthur you
have not stop awai from here for a dai and a half in order to write
letter what is the matter with you
well if you must know mildr i detest your friend lord minster
the mere sight of him set my teeth on edg and i did not want to
meet him i onli came here todai becaus ladi florenc told me that
thei were go up to the convent thi afternoon
so you have been to see ladi florenc
no i met her bui fruit yesterdai and went for a walk with her
in the interv of the letterwrit
ye
well do you know i detest ladi florenc
that is veri unkind of you she is charm
from your point of view perhap as her brother is from mine
do you mean to tell me that you think that horrid fellow charm
ask arthur in disgust
why should i not
oh for the matter of that there is no reason why you should not but
i cant congratul you either on your friend or your tast
leav my tast out of the question why do you call lord minster my
friend
becaus miss terri told me that he wa she said that he wa alwai
propos to you and that you would probabl marri him in the end
mildr blush faintli
she ha no busi to tell you but for the matter of that so have
mani other men it doe not follow that becaus thei choos to
propos to me thei ar my friend
no but then thei have not marri you
no more ha he but while we ar talk of it why should i not
marri lord minster he can give me posit influenc everyth
that is dear to a woman except the rarest of all giftslov
but is love so rare mildr
ye the love that it can satisfi a woman either to receiv or to
give especi the latter for in thi we ar more bless in give
than in receiv it is but veri rare that the most fortun of us
get a chanc of accept such love as i mean and we can onli give it
onc in our live but you have not told me your reason against my
marri lord minster
becaus he is a meanspirit selfish man if he were not he could
not have talk as he did last night becaus you do not love him
mildr you cannot love such a man as that if he were fifti time a
member of the govern
what doe it matter to you arthur she said in a voic of
indescrib soft bend her sunni head low over her work
whether i love him or not my do so would not make your heart beat
the faster
i dont wish you to marri him he said confusedli
she rais her head and look full at him with ey which shone like
star through a summer mist
that is enough arthur she answer in a tone of gentl
submiss if you do not wish it i will not and rise she left
the room
arthur blush furious at her word and a new sensat crept over
him
sure he said to himself she cannot no of cours she onli
mean that she will take my advic
but though he dismiss the suspicion thu readili it left someth
that he could not quit defin behind it he had after the manner of
young men were women ar concern thought that he understood mildr
thoroughli now he came to the modest conclus that he knew veri
littl about her
on the follow afternoon when he wa at the quinta talk as usual
to mr carr he saw lord minster come up the step of the portico
dress in much the same wai and with exactli the same air as he wa
accustom to assum when he mount those of the reform or
occasion if he thought that the hungri elector want
pander to those of the new nation club
hullo said arthur here come lord minster in hi war paint frock
coat tall hat eyeglass and all goodby
why do you go awai arthur stop and protect me said mildr
laugh
oh no inde i dont want to spoil sport i would not interfer
with your amus on ani account
mildr look a littl vex
well you will come back to dinner
that depend upon what happen
i told you what would happen arthur goodby
perhap it is as well to get it over at onc thought mildr
in the hall arthur met lord minster and thei pass with a gestur of
recognit so infinitesim small that it almost fade into the
nothing of a cut so far as he could condescend to notic so low
a thing at all hi lordship had conceiv a great dislik for arthur
how do you do lord minster said mildr cordial i hear that
you went to the convent yesterdai what did you think of the view
the view mr carrwa there a view i did not notic it inde i
onli went up there at all to pleas florenc i dont like that sort
of thing
if you dont like rough it i am afraid that you did not enjoi
your voyag out
well no i dont think i did and there wa a low fellow on board
who had been ruin by the retrocess of the transvaal and who
hear that i wa in the govern took everi possibl opportun
to tell me publicli that hi wife and children were almost in a state
of starvat as though i care about hi confound wife and
children he wa posit brutal no certainli i did not enjoi it
howev i am reward by find you here
i am veri much flatter
lord minster fix hi eyeglass firmli in hi ey plant hi hand
at the bottom of hi trouser pocket and clear hi throat
place himself in the attitud that wa so familiar to the hous and
began
mr carr i told you when last i had the pleasur of see you
that i should take the first opportun of renew a convers
that i wa forc to suspend in order to attend if my memori serv
me a veri import committe meet i wa therefor surpris
inde i mai almost sai hurt when i found that you had suddenli
flit from london
inde lord minster
i will not howev take up the time of thisi mean your time by
recapitul all that i told you on that occas the fact ar so
to speak all upon the tabl and i will mere touch upon the main
head of my case my prospect ar these i am now a member of the
cabinet and enjoi ow to the unusu but calcul reckless
of my nonoffici public utter an extraordinari popular with
a larg section of the countri the hungri section to which i allud
last night it is probabl that the cours of the present govern
is pretti nearli run the countri is sick of it and those who put it
into power have not got enough out of it a dissolut is therefor
an event of the near futur the conserv will come in but thei
have no power of organ and veri littl polit talent at
their back abov all thei ar defici in energi probabl becaus
there is noth that thei can destroi and therefor no pick to
struggl for in short thei ar not capac imperii the want of
these qualiti and of leader will veri soon undermin their hold
upon the countri alwai a slight on and assist by a few other
push men i anticip by carefulli plai into the hand of the
irish parti which will realli rule england in the futur be abl
as on of the leader of the opposit to consumm their downfal
then will come my opportun and if luck goe with me i shall be
first lord of the treasuri within half a dozen year but now come
the difficulti though i am so popular with the countri i am for
some reason quit inexplic to myself rather at ahuma discount
amongst my colleagu and that influenti section of societi to which
thei belong now in order to succe to the full extent that i have
plan it is absolut essenti that i should win the counten
of thi class and the onli wai that i can see of do it is by
marri some woman charm enough to disarm dislik beauti
enough to command admir rich enough to entertain profus and
clever enough to rule england those desiderata ar all to a strike
degre unit in your person mr carr and i have therefor much
pleasur in ask you to becom my wife
you have as i understand you lord minster made a veri admir
statement of how desir it is for yourself that you should marri
me but it is not so clear what advantag i should reap by marri
you
why the advantag ar obviou if by your help i can becom prime
minist you would becom the wife of the prime minist
the prospect fail to dazzl me i have everyth that i want why
should i strive to reach a grandeur to which i wa not born and
which to speak the truth i regard with a veri complet indiffer
but there is anoth point in all your speech you have said noth
of ani affect that you have to offer not a singl word of love
you have been content to expati on the profit that a matrimoni
invest would bring to yourself and by reflect to the other
contract parti
love ask lord minster with an express of genuin surpris
why you talk like a charact in a novel now tell me mr carr
what is love
it is difficult to defin lord minster but as you ask me to do so
i will try love to a woman is what the sun is to the world it is her
life her anim principl without which she must droop and if
the plant be veri tender die except under it influenc a woman can
never attain her full growth never touch the height of her
possibl or bloom into the plenitud of her moral beauti a
loveless marriag dwarf our natur a marriag where love is
develop them to their utmost
and what is love to a man
well i should sai that nine of a man passion ar mere episod
in hi career the mileston that mark hi path the tenth or the
first is hi philosoph stone that turn all thing to gold or
if the charm doe not work leav hi heart broken and bankrupt a
cold monument of failur
i dont quit follow you and i must sai that speak for myself i
never felt anyth of all thi said lord minster blankli
i know you do not lord minster your onli passion tend toward
polit triumph and person aggrandis we ar at the two
pole you see and i fear that we can never never meet upon a common
matrimoni line but dont be downheart about it you will find
plenti more women who fulfil all your requir and will be veri
happi to take you at your own valuat if onli a woman is necessari
to success you need not look far and forgiv me if i sai that i
believ it will not make much differ to you who she is but all
the same lord minster i will ventur to give you a piec of advic
next time you propos address yourself a littl more to the ladi
affect and a littl less to her interest and mr carr rose as
though to show that the interview wa at an end
am i then to understand that my offer is definit refus ask
lord minster stiffli
i am afraid so and i am sure that you will on reflect see how
utterli unsuit we ar to each other
possibl mr carr possibl at present all that i see is that you
have had a great opportun and have fail to avail yourself of it
my onli consol is that the loss will be your and my onli regret
is that i have had the troubl of come to thi place for noth
howev there is a ship due tomorrow and i shall sail in her
i am sorri to have been the caus of bring you here lord minster
and still more sorri that you should feel oblig to cut short your
stai goodby lord minster we part friend i hope
oh certainli mr carr i wish you a veri good morn mr carr
and hi lordship march out of mildr life
there goe my chanc of becom the wife of a prime minist and
make a figur in histori said that ladi as she watch hi tall
figur stalk stiffli down the avenu well i am glad of it i
would just as soon have marri a speechmak figurehead stuf
full of the purest radic principl
on the follow dai arthur met ladi florenc again in the town
where have you been to ladi florenc he said
to see my brother off she answer without ani sign of deep
grief
what ha he gone alreadi

ladi florenc wa noth if not outspoken
chapter xliii
a week or so after the departur of lord minster mildr suggest
that thei should on the follow dai vari their amus by go
up to the convent a build perch on the hill some thousand feet
abov the town of funchal in palanquin or rather hammock swung
upon long pole arthur who had never yet travel in these
luxuri convey jump at the idea and even miss terri when
she discov that she wa to be carri made no object the
parti wa complet by the addit of a newlymarri coupl of whom
mr carr had known someth at home and who had come to madeira to
spend the honeymoon ladi florenc also had been ask but rather to
arthur disappoint she could not come
when the long line of swing hammock each with it two sturdi
bearer were marshal and the adventur voyag had settl
themselv in them thei realli form quit an impos process
head as it wa by the extras on that carri miss terri who
complain bitterli that the thing wobbl and made her feel sick
but to arthur mind there wa someth effemin in allow
himself a strong activ man to be cart up hill as steep as the
side of a hous by two perspir wretch so hot as it wa he to
the intens amus of hi bearer elect to get out and walk the
newlymarri man follow hi exampl and for a while thei went on

yard behind miss terri shortli afterward thei observ a signal
of distress be flown by that ladi whose arm wa to be seen
violent agit her green veil from between the curtain of her
hammock which immedi came to a dead stop
what is it cri arthur and mildr in a breath as thei arriv
on the scene of the suppos disast
my dear mildr will you be so kind as to tell that man point
to her front bearer a stout flabbi individu that he must not go
on carri me i must have a cooler man it make me posit ill
to see him puf and blow and drip under my nose like a fresh
bast joint
miss terri realist descript of her bearer appear which
wa to sai the least of it limp and moist wa no exagger but
then she herself as arthur well rememb wa no featherweight
especi when as in the present case she had to be cart up the
side of a nearli perpendicular hill some mile long a fact veri well
exemplifi by the condit of the bearer
my dear agatha repli mildr laugh what is to be done of
cours the man is hot you ar not a featherweight but what is to be
done
i dont know but i wont go on with him it simpli disgust he
might let himself out as a wateringcart
but we cant get anoth here
then he must cool himself the other might come and fan him i wont
go on till he is cool and that flat
he will take hour to cool and meanwhil we ar broil on thi hot
road you realli must come on agatha
i have it said arthur miss terri must turn herself round with her
head toward the back of the hammock and then she wont see him
to thi arrang the aggriev ladi wa after some difficulti
persuad to acced and the process start again
their destin reach thei picnick as thei had arrang and
then separ the bride and bridegroom stroll off in on
direct and mildr and arthur in anoth whilst miss terri
mount guard over the plate and dish
present arthur and mildr came to a littl englishlook grove of
pine and oak that extend down a gentl slope and wa border by a
steep bank at the foot of which great fern and beauti madeira
flower twine themselv into a shelter from the heat here thei sat
down and gaze at the splendid and manytint view set in it
background of emerald ocean
what a view it is said arthur look mildr how dark the clump
of sugarcan look against the green of the vine and how pretti the
red roof of the town ar peep out of the grove of fruittre do
you see the great shadow thrown upon the sea by that cliff how deep
and cool the water look within it and how it sparkl where the sun
strike
ye it is beauti and the pine smell sweet
i wish angela could see it he said half to himself mildr who
wa ly back lazili among the fern her hat off her ey close
so that the long dark lash lai upon her cheek and her head rest
on her arm suddenli start up
what is the matter
noth you woke me from a sort of dream that all
thi spring i rememb go with her to look at a view near the
abbei hous and sayingwhat i often think when i look at anyth

she said that to her it spoke of immort and that in everyth
around her she saw evid of etern life
she must be veri fortun shall i tell you of what it remind me
what
of neither death nor immort but of the full happi puls
exist of the hour and of the beauti world that pessimist like
yourself and mystic like your angela think so poorli of but which is
realli so gloriou and so rich in joi why thi sunlight and those
flower and the wide sparkl of that sea ar each and all a
happi and the health in our vein and the beauti in our ey
deep pleasur that we never realiz till we lose them death inde
come to us all but why add to it terror by think of them whilst
it is far off and as for life after death it is a faint vagu
thing more like to be horribl than happi thi world is our onli
realiti the onli thing that we can grasp here alon we know that
we can enjoi and yet how we wast our short opportun for
enjoy soon youth will have slip awai and we shall be too old
for love rose fade fastest arthur when the sun is bright in the
even when thei have fallen and the ground is red with wither

wild yell of a green veil flutter through the air and of a fall
as on to a featherb miss terri superior weight had brought her
to her mother earth the first and he after a higher heavenward
flight had lit upon the top of her he pick her up and sat her down
against a wall to recov her breath and then fish mildr dirti

on her face too wa the same express of quiet power of consciou
superior and calm command that had alwai distinguish it arthur

after breakfast arthur volunt to take ladi bellami round the
garden with the ulterior object of extract some more inform
about angela it must be rememb that he had no caus to mistrust
that ladi nor had he ani knowledg of the event which had recent
happen in the neighbourhood of the abbei hous he wa therefor

left to himself arthur rememb that he also had an appoint to
keepnam to meet mildr by the cathedr step and go with her
to choos some madeira jewelleri an undertak which she did not
feel compet to carri out without hi assist
when he reach the cathedr he found her rather cross at have
been kept wait for ten minut
it is veri rude of you she said but i suppos that you were so
taken up with the convers of your friend that you forgot the
time by the wai who ar thei anybodi you have told me about
in the paus of select the jewelleri arthur told her all he knew
about the bellami and of their connect with the neighbourhood of
the abbei hous the stori caus mildr to open her brown ey and
look thought just as thei came out of the shop who should thei
run into but the bellami themselv chaffer for madeira work with
a woman in the street arthur stop and spoke to them and then
introduc mr carr who after a littl convers ask them up
to lunch
after thi mildr and ladi bellami met a good deal the two women
interest each other
on night when the bellami had been about ten dai in madeira the
convers took a person turn sir john and arthur were sit
over their wine thei were dine with mr carr agatha terri wa
fast asleep on a sofa so that ladi bellami and mildr seat upon
loungingchair by a tabl with a light on it place by an open
window were practic alon
oh by the wai ladi bellami said mildr after a paus i
believ that you ar acquaint with the young ladi to whom mr
heigham is engag she had meant to sai to be marri but the
word stuck in her throat
oh ye i know her well
i am so glad i am quit curiou to hear what she is like on can
never put much faith in lover raptur you know
do you mean in person or in charact
both
well angela caresfoot is as love a woman as ever i saw with a
nobl figur wellset head and magnific ey and hair
mildr turn a littl pale and bit her lip
as to her charact i can hardli describ it she live in an
atmospher of her own an atmospher that i cannot reach or at ani
rate cannot breath but if you can imagin a woman whose mind is
enrich with learn as profound as that of the first classic
scholar of the dai and ting with an origin all her own a
woman whose faith is as steadi as that star and whose love is deep as
the sea and as definit as it tide who live to higher end than
those we strive for whose whole life inde give on the idea that
it is the shadowimperfect perhap but still the shadowof an
immort light then you will get some idea of angela caresfoot she
is a woman intellectu physic and spiritu immeasur
abov the man on whom she ha set her affect
that cannot be said mildr softli like draw to like she must
have found someth in him some better part some affin of which
you know noth
after thi she fell into silenc present ladi bellami rais her
ey just now fill up with the great pupil and fix them on
mildr
you ar think she said slowli that angela caresfoot is a
formid rival
mildr start
how can you pretend to read my thought
she laugh a littl
i am an adept at the art dont be downheart i should not be
surpris if after all the engag between mr heigham and angela
caresfoot should come to noth of cours i speak in perfect
confid
of cours
well the marriag is not altogeth agreeabl to the father who
would prefer anoth and more suitabl match but unfortun
there is no wai of shake the young ladi determin
inde
but i think that with assist a wai might be found
their ey met and thi time mildr took up the parabl
should i be wrong ladi bellami if i suppos that you have not come
to madeira sole for pleasur
a wise person alwai tri to combin busi and pleasur
and in thi case the busi combin is in connect with mr
heigham engag
exactli
and suppos that i were to tell him thi
had i not known that you would on no account tell mr heigham i
should not have told you
and how do you know that
i will answer your question by anoth did you ever yet know a
woman who love a man willingli help him to the arm of a rival
unless inde she wa forc to it she ad with someth like a
sigh
mildr carr snowi bosom heav tumultu and the roseleaf hue
fade from her cheek
you mean that i am in love with arthur heigham on what do you base
that belief
on a base as broad as the pyramid of which you were talk at
dinner public report not nearli so mislead a guid as peopl
think your face your voic your ey all betrai you why do you
alwai try to get near him to touch himansw me that i have seen
you do it three time thi even onc you hand him a book in
order to touch hi hand beneath it but there is no need to enumer
what you doubtless veri well rememb no nice woman mr carr ever
like to continu touch a man unless she love him you ar alwai
listen for hi voic and step you ar listen for them now your
ey follow hi face as a dog doe hi masterswhen you speak to
him your voic is a caress in itself shall i go on
i think that it is unnecessari whether you be right or not i will
give you the credit of be a close observ
to observ with me is at onc a task and an amus and the habit
is on that lead me to accur conclus as i think you will
admit the conclus i have come to in your case is that you do not
wish to see arthur heigham marri to anoth woman i spoke just now
of assist
i have none to give i will give none how could i look him in the
face
you ar strang scrupul for a woman in your posit
i have alwai tri to behav like an honour woman ladi bellami
and i do not feel inclin to do otherwis now
perhap you will think differ when it come to the point but in
the meanwhil rememb that peopl who will not help themselv
cannot expect to be help
onc and for all ladi bellami understand me i fight for my own
hand with the weapon which natur and fortun have given me and by
myself i will stand or fall i will join in no scheme to separ
arthur from thi woman if i cannot win him for myself by myself i
will at ani rate lose him fairli i will respect what you have told
me but i will do no more
ladi bellami smile as she answer
i realli admir your courag it is quit quixot hush here come
the gentlemen
chapter xlv
a few dai after the dinner at the quinta carr the bellami visit to
madeira drew to a close on the even befor their departur arthur
volunt to take ladi bellami down to the parad to hear the band
plai after thei had walk about a while under the shade of the
magnoliatre which were star all over with creami cup of bloom
and suffici inspect the gai throng of portugues inhabit
and english visitor made gayer still by the amazingli gorgeou
uniform of the offici arthur spi two chair in a compar
quiet corner and suggest that thei should sit down
ladi bellami he said after hesit a while you ar a woman of
the world and i believ a friend of my own i want to ask your advic
about someth
it is entir at your servic mr heigham
well realli it is veri awkward
shall i turn my head so as not to see your blush
dont laugh at me ladi bellami of cours you will sai noth of
thi
if you doubt my discret mr heigham do not choos me as a
confidant you ar go unless i am mistaken to speak to me about
mr carr
ye it is about her but how did you know that you alwai seem to
be abl to read on thought befor on speak do you know
sometim i think that she ha taken a fanci to me do you see and i
want to ask you what you thought about it
well suppos that she had most young men mr heigham would not
talk of such a thing in a tone befit a great catastroph but if
i am not enter too deepli into particular what make you think
so
well realli i dont exactli know she sometim give me a gener
idea
oh then there ha been noth tangibl
well ye onc she took my hand or i took her i dont know which
but i dont think much of that becaus it the sort of thing that
alwai happen dont you know and nine time out of ten mean
noth at all but why i ask you about it is that if there is
anyth of the sort i had better cut and run out of thi becaus it
would not be fair to stop either to her or to angela or myself it
would be danger you see plai with such a woman as mildr
so you would go awai if you thought that she took ani warmer interest
in you than ladi gener do in men engag to be marri
certainli i should
well then i think that i can set your mind at eas i have observ
mr carr pretti close and in the wai you suppos she care for you
no more than she doe for your coat she is no doubt a bit of a
flirt and veri like wish to get you to fall in love with hera
natur ambit on the part of a woman but as for be in love
with you herself the idea is absurd women of the world do not fall
in love so readili thei ar too much taken up with think about
themselv to have time to think about anybodi els with them it is
all self self self from morn till night besid look at the
commonsens side of the thing do you suppos it like that a person
of mr carr wealth and beauti who ha onli to lift her hand to
have all london at her feet is like to fix her affect upon a
young man whom she know is alreadi engag to be marri and who
forgiv me if i sai soha not got the same recommend to her
favour that mani of her suitor have it is of cours quit possibl
that mr carr societi mai be danger to you in which case it
might be wise for you to go but i realli do not think that you need
feel ani anxieti on her account she find you a charm companion
and in some wai a us on and that is all when you go somebodi
els will soon fill the vacant space
then that all right said arthur though somehow he did not feel
as wildli delight as he should have done at hear it so clearli
demonstr that mildr did not care a brass button about him but
then that is human natur between eighteen and thirtyf nineti
per cent of the men in the world would like to centr in themselv
the affect of everi young and pretti woman thei know even if
there wa not the ghost of a chanc of their marri on of them the
same tendenc is to be observ convers in the other sex onli in
their case with a still smaller proport of except
by the wai ask arthur present how is my late guardian mr
georg caresfoot
not at all well i am sorri to sai i am veri anxiou about hi
health he is in the south of england now for a chang
i am sorri he is ill do you know i daresai you will think me
absurd but you have taken a weight off my mind i alwai had an idea
that he want to marri angela and sometim i am afraid that i have
suspect that philip caresfoot cart me off in order to give him a
chanc you see philip is uncommonli fond of monei and georg is
rich
what an absurd idea mr heigham why georg look upon matrimoni as
an institut of the evil on he admir angela i knowh alwai
doe admir a pretti face but as for dream of marri a girl half
hi ag and hi own cousin into the bargain it is about the last
thing that he would do
i am glad to hear it i am sure i have been uncomfort enough
think about him sometim ladi bellami will you do someth for
me
what is that mr heigham
tell angela all about me
but would that be quit honour mr heighamund the condit
of your engag i mean
you never promis not to talk about me i onli promis not to
attempt verbal or written commun with angela
well i will tell her that i met you and that you ar well and if
philip will allow me i will tell her more but of cours i dont know
if he will or not what ring is that you wear
it is on that angela gave me when we becam engag it wa her
mother
will you let me look at it
arthur held out hi hand the ring wa an antiqu a larg emerald
cut like a seal and heavili set in a band of dull gold on the face of
the stone were engrav some mysteri charact
what is that engrav on the stone
i am not sure but angela told me that mr fraser had taken an
impress of it and forward it to a great orient scholar hi
friend said that the stone must be extrem ancient as the charact
is a form of sanscrit and that he believ the word to mean for
ever or etern angela said that it had been in her mother
famili for gener and wa suppos to have been brought from the
east about the year 1700 that is all i know about it
the motto is better suit to a weddingr than to an engag
stone said ladi bellami with on of her dark smile
why
becaus engag ar like promis and piecrust made to be
broken
i hope that will not be the case with our howev said arthur
attempt a laugh
i hope not i am sure but never pin your faith absolut to ani
woman or you will regret it alwai accept her oath and
protest as you would a polit statement polit and with
an appear of perfect faith but with a certain grain of mistrust
woman fidel is in the main a fiction we ar faith just as men
ar so long as it suit us to be so with thi differ howev
men plai fals from passion or impuls women from calcul
you do not draw a pleas pictur of your own sex
when is the truth pleas it is onli when we cloth it naked
with the rag of imagin or sweeten it with fiction that it can
pleas of itself it is so ugli a thing that societi in it
refin will not even hear it but prefer to emploi a
correspond formula thu all passion howev vile is call by
the name of love all superstiti terror and grovel attempt
to concili the unseen ar known as religion while selfish greed
and the hungri lust for power masquerad as laudabl ambit men
and women especi women hate the truth becaus like the
electr light it show them as thei ar and that is vile it ha
grown so strang to them from disus that like pilat thei do not
even know what it is i wa go to sai howev that if you care to
trust me with it i think i see how i can take a messag to angela for
youwithout either caus you to break your promis or do
anyth dishonour myself
how
well if you like i will take her that ring i think that is a veri
gener offer on my part for i do not like the respons
but what is the us of take her the ring
it is someth that there can be no mistak about that is all a
speak messag from yourself but dont give it me if you do not
like perhap you had rather not
i dont like part with it at all i confess but i should dearli
like to send her someth i suppos that you would not take a
letter
you would not write on mr heigham
no of cours i forget that accurs promis here take the ring
and sai all you can to angela with it you promis that you will
certainli i promis that i will sai all i can
you ar veri good and kind i wish to heaven that i were go to
marlshir with you if you onli knew how i long to see her again i
think that it would break my heart if anyth happen to separ
us and hi lip quiver at the thought
ladi bellami turn her sombr face upon himther wa compass in
her ey
if you bear angela caresfoot so great a love be guid by me and
shake it off strangl itb rid of it anyhow for fulfil
affect of that natur would carri a larger happi with it than
is allow in a world plan expressli to secur the greatest miseri
of the greatest number there is a fate which fight against it it
minist ar human folli and passion you have seen mani marriag
tell me how mani have you known out of a novel where the peopl
marri their true love in novel thei alwai do it is anoth of
societi pleasant fiction but real life is like a novel without the
third volum i do not want to alarm you mr heigham but becaus i
like you i ask you to steel your mind to disappoint so that if
a blow come it mai not crush you
what do you mean ladi bellami do you know of ani impend
troubl
i certainli not i onli talk on gener principl do not be over
confid and never trust a woman come let us get home
next morn when arthur came down to breakfast the bellami had
sail the mail had come in from the cape at midnight and left again
at dawn take them with it
chapter xlvi
the departur of the bellami left arthur in veri low spirit hi
sensat were similar to those which on can well imagin an ancient
greek might have experienc who have sent to consult the delphic
oracl had got for hi pain a veri unsatisfactori repli
foreshadow evil but not actual defin them ladi bellami wa
in some wai connect with the idea of an oracl in hi mind she
look oracular her dark face and inscrut ey the stamp of
power upon her brow all suggest that she wa a mistress of the
black art her word too were mysteri and fraught with bitter
wisdom and a deep knowledg distil from the poison weed of
life
arthur felt with someth like a shudder that if ladi bellami
prophesi evil evil wa follow hard upon her word and in
warn him not to place hi whole heart happi upon on ventur
lest it should meet with shipwreck he wa sure that she wa
prophesi with a knowledg of the futur deni to ordinari mortal
how earnestli too she had caution him against put absolut
faith in angelaso earnestli inde that her talk had left a
flavour of distrust in hi mind yet how could he mistrust angela
nor wa he comfort by a remark that fell from mildr carr the
afternoon follow the departur of the mail rais her ey she
glanc at hi hand
what ar you look at he said
wa not that queer emerald you wore your engag ring
ye
what have you done with it
i gave it to ladi bellami to give to angela
what for
to show her that i am aliv and well i mai not write you know
you ar veri confid
what do you mean
noth at least i mean that i dont think that i should care to
hand over my engag ring so easili it might be misappli you
know
thi view of the matter help to fill up the cup of arthur nervou
anxieti and he vainli pli mildr with question to get her to
elucid her mean and state her caus of suspicion if she had
ani but she would sai noth more on the subject which then
drop and wa not allud to again between them
after the bellami departur the time wore on at madeira without
bring about ani appreci chang in the situat but mildr
saw that their visit had rob her of ani advantag she had gain
over arthur for thei had as it were brought angela atmospher
with them and faint though it wa it suffic to overpow her
influenc he made no move forward and seem to have entir
forgotten the episod on the hill when he had gone so veri near
disast on the contrari he appear to her to grow increasingli
preoccupi as time went on and to look upon her more and more in the
light of a sister till at length her patienc wore thin
as for her passion it grew almost unrestrain in it confin
now she drift like a rudderless vessel on a sea which rage
continu and knew no space of calm and so littl oil wa pour
upon the troubl water there were so few break in the stormwal
that rose black between her and the desir haven of her rest inde
she began to doubt if even her poor power of charm him as at first
she had been abl to do with the sparkl of her wit and the half
unconsci displai of her natur grace wa not on the wane and if
she wa not near to lose her precari foothold in hi esteem and
affect the thought that he might be tire of her struck her like
a freez wind and for a moment turn her heart to ic
poor mildr higher than ever abov her head bloom that blue rose
she long to pluck would she ever reach it after all her strive
even to gather on poor leaf on wither petal the path which led
to it wa veri hard to climb and below the breaker boil would it
after all be her fate to fall down into that gulf of which the
sorrow water could bring neither death nor forget
and so christma came and went
on dai when thei were all sit in the drawingroom some eight
week after the bellami had left and mildr wa let her mind
run on such thought as these arthur who had been read a novel

the waltz befor supper and the last galop
you will danc me off my head it is danger to waltz with ani on
so pretti he said in that banter tone he often took with her

moment capabl of accur thought how long thi report had been
go about and whether by ani chanc it had reach the ear of the
bellami if it had the mischief might be veri seriou in the
confus of hi mind onli two thing were clear to himon wa
that both for mildr and hi own sake he must leav madeira at
onc and secondli that he would danc no more with her that night
meanwhil the ball wa draw to a close and present he heard the
strain of the last galop strike up after the band had been plai
for a minut or two a natur curios drew him to the door of the
ballroom to see if mildr wa danc with anybodi els here he
found ladi florenc look rather disconsol
how is it that you ar not danc she ask
he murmur someth inaud about partner
well we ar in the same box what do you think i promis thi
galop to captain clemenc and now there he is vainli try to
persuad mr carr who wont look at him and appear to be wait
for somebodi elsey i should thinkto give him the danc i will
be even with him though
just then the music reach a peculiarli seduct passag
oh come along said ladi florenc quit regardless of the
proprieti and befor arthur well knew where he wa he wa
whirl round the room
mr carr wa stand at the top corner where the crush oblig him
to slacken hi pace and as he did so he caught her ey she wa
talk to ladi florenc faithless partner with a smile upon her
lip but on glanc at her face suffic to tell him that she wa in
a royal rage and what wa more with himself hi partner notic
it too and wa amus
unless i am mistaken mr heigham you have come into troubl look
at mr carr and she laugh
but that wa not all either from sheer mischief or from curios to
see what would happen she insist upon stop as the danc drew
to a close by mildr corner that ladi howev prove herself
equal to the occas
mr heigham she said sweetli do you know that that wa our
danc
oh wa it he repli feel veri much a fool

smile toward ladi florenceit is not wonder that you made a
mistak and as you look so contrit you shall be forgiven agatha

that her ey seem to flash but her anger onli made her look more
love suppli as it did an ad digniti and charm to her sweet
featur nor did she allow it to have full plai

admit of be trifl with she knew how unlik it wa that she
would ever have a better chanc with arthur than she had now for the
mirror told her that she wa look her loveliest which wa veri
love inde in addit she wa surround by everi seduct
circumst that could assist to compel a young man howev much
engag to commit himself by some act or word of folli the sound
and sight of beauti the rich odour of flower the music
voluptu swell and last but not least the pressur of her
graciou form and the glanc from her ey which alon were enough
to make fool of ninetynin out of everi hundr young men in europ
all these thing combin to help her and to them must be ad her
determin that concentr strength of will emploi to a singl

such sensat as take possess of my mind when i pass from the
stori of mildr as she wa then stormtoss and love to angela
as love inde and yet more anxiou but simplemind as a child
and not doubt for the end thei were both flower inde and both
beauti but between them there wa a wide differ the on in
the rich of her splendour gaze upon the close place where she
queen it and wa satisfi with the beauti round her or if not
satisfi she could imagin none differ the limit of that littl
spot form the horizon of her mindsh knew no world beyond the
other full of possibl shed sweet even on the blast which
cut her and look up for shelter toward the blue sky she knew
endur etern abov the drive cloud
whilst sir john bellami health wa be recruit at madeira
angela daili life pursu an even and compar speak a
happi cours she miss pigott much but then she often went to see
her and by wai of compens if she had gone so had georg
caresfoot and ladi bellami mr fraser too had come back to fill a
space in the void of her loneli and for hi presenc she wa veri
grate inde none but herself could know the comfort and strength
she gather from hi friendship none but himself could know what it
cost him to comfort her but he did not shrink from the duti inde
it gave him a melancholi satisfact he love her quit as dearli

most sacr thought to the memori of her absent lover and all her
quick energi to selfprepar for hi come possess her soul
in patienc
and thu her young life began to bloom again with a fresh promis the
close of each depart dai wa the signal for the lift of a
portion of her load for it brought her a dai nearer to her lover
arm subtract someth from the long tale of barren hour sinc
to her all hour seem most barren that were not quicken by hi
presenc inde no arctic winter could be colder and more devoid of
light and life than thi time of absenc wa to her and had it not
been for the warm splendour of her hope shoot it beauti
promis in unreal gleam across the black of her horizon she felt
as though she must have frozen and di for hope elus as she is
often bear a fairer outward mien than the realiz to which she
point and like a fond deceiv serv to keep the heart aliv till
the first bitter is overpast and school in troubl it can
know her fals and yet remain unbroken
but sometim angela mood would chang and then to her strain
and sensit mind thi dead calm and cessat of event would seem
to resembl that omin moment when in tropic sea the fierc
outrid of the tempest ha pass howl awai cloth in fly
foam then come a calm and for a space there is blue sky and the
sail flap drearili against the mast and the vessel onli rock from
the violenc of her past plung while the scream of the seabird is
heard with unnatur clear for there is no sound nor motion in
the air intens still grow the silenc and the water almost ceas
from toss but the seaman know that present with a sudden roar
the armi of the wind and wave will leap upon him and that a
struggl for life is at hand
such fear howev did not often take her for unlik arthur she
wa natur of a hope mind and when thei did mr fraser would
find mean to comfort her but thi wa soon to chang
on afternoonit wa christma eveangela went down the villag to
see pigott now comfort establish in the hous her long depart
husband had left her it wa a miser decemb dai a damp
unpleas ghost of a dai and all the sky wa pack with cloud
while the surfac of the earth wa wrap in mist rain and snow fell
noiselessli by turn inde the onli sound in the air wa the loud
drip of water from the tree on the dead leav beneath the whole
outlook wa melancholi in the extrem while angela wa in her old
nurs cottag the snow fell in earnest for an hour or so and then
held up again and when she came out the mist had recov it
supremaci and now the snow wa melt
come miss you must be get home or it will be dark shall i

by the faint roll of carriagewheel over the snow as she turn half
involuntarili to see who it wa that travel so fast the creep
mist wa driven asid by a puff of wind and she saw a splendid blood
hors draw an open victoria trot past her at at least twelv
mile an hour but quickli as it pass it wa not too quick for her
to recogn ladi bellami wrap up in fur her dark stern face
look on straight befor her as though the mist had no power to dim
her sight next second the dark close in and the carriag had

upon the ruin of hi pictur
next morn be christma dai ladi bellami went to church as
behov a good christian and listen to the divin messag of peac
on earth and goodwil toward men so for the matter of that did
georg and so did angela after church ladi bellami went home to
lunch but she wa in no mood for eat so she left the tabl and
order the victoria to be round in half an hour
after church too angela and mr fraser at their christma dinner
angela melancholi had to some extent melt beneath the genial
influenc of the christmastid and her mind had taken comfort from
the word of peac and everlast love that she had heard that
morn and for awhil at ani rate she had forgotten her
forebod the unaccustom splendour of the dinner too had
divert her attent for she wa easili pleas with such thing
and altogeth she wa in a more comfort frame of mind than she
had been on the previou even and wa inclin to indulg in a
pleasant talk with mr fraser upon variou subject mostli classic
and arthurian she had alreadi crack some filbert for him pluck
by herself in the autumn and special save in a damp jar and wa
about to settl herself in a chair by the fire when suddenli she
turn white and stood quit still
hark she said do you hear it

ladi bellami horseth big black hors that trot so fast
i can hear noth angela
but i can she is on the highroad yet she will be here veri soon

becam distinctli audibl

a minut elaps and then mr jake now the onli servant in the
hous wa heard shuffl along the passag follow by a firm
light step
dont leav me said angela to mr fraser god give me strength to
bear it she went on beneath her breath she wa still stand
stare vacantli toward the door pale and her bosom heav the
intens of her anxieti had to some extent commun itself to mr
fraser for there ar few thing so catch as anxieti except
enthusiasm he too had risen and wa stand in an attitud of
expect
ladi bellami to see yer said mr jake push her head through
the halfopen door
next second she had enter
i must apolog for disturb you at dinner angela she began
hurriedli and then stop and also stood still there wa someth
veri curiou about her recept she thought both mr fraser and
angela might have been cut out of stone for neither move
stand thu in the silenc of expect the three made a strang
pictur on ladi bellami face there wa a look of stern
determin and suppress excit such as becam on about to
commit a crime
at last she broke the silenc
i come to bring you bad new angela she said
what have you to sai tell me quick no stop hear me befor you
speak if you have come here with ani evil in your heart or with the
intent to deceiv or betrai paus befor you answer i am a lone

sinc we have at last a friend whose vengeanc you too must fear so
by the love of christ and by the presenc of the god who made you
speak to me onli such truth as you will utter at hi judgment now
answer i am readi
at her word spoken with an earnest and in a voic which made
them almost aw a momentari express of fear swept across ladi
bellami face but it went as quickli as it came and the hard
determin look return the mysteri ey grew cold and glitter
the head erect itself at that moment ladi bellami distinctli
remind mr fraser of a hood cobra about to strike
am i to speak befor mr fraser

what is the good of thi highflown talk angela you seem to know my
new befor i give it and believ me it pain me veri much to have to

the cobra had struck but as yet the poison had scarc begun to
work there wa onli numb mr fraser gave a gasp and half
drop half fell into hi chair the nois attract angela
attent and press her hand to her forehead she turn toward
him with a ghost of a laugh
did i not tell you that thi evil woman would bring evil new then
address ladi bellami but stop you forget what i said to you you
do not speak the truth arthur dead how can arthur be dead and i
aliv how is it that i do not know he is dead oh for shame it is

ladi bellami hoars but if you will not believ me look here

dead hand that it might be given back to you
if mr heigham is dead said mr fraser how do you know it where

whisper of your wing have you no voic in the silenc you see he

angela almost snatch the paper from her outstretch hand it ran
thu in charact almost illeg from weak

back your ring when it is over try to forget me and be happi
too weak to write more goodby god
at the foot of thi broken and almost illeg letter wa scrawl
the word arthur
angela read it slowli and then at length the poison did it work she
did not speak wildli ani more or call upon arthur she wa stung back
to sens but all the light went out of her ey
it is hi write she said slowli i beg your pardon it wa good
of you to nurs him
then press the paper to her bosom with on hand with the other
she grope her wai toward the door
it is veri dark she said
ladi bellami ey gave a flash of triumph and then she stood
watch the pitiabl exhibit of human miseri as curious as ever
a roman matron did an expir gladiat when angela wa near the
door the letter still press against her heart she spoke again
the blow come from god angela and the religion and spiritu
theori which you believ in will bring you consol most like
it is a bless in disguisea thing that you will in time even learn
to be thank for
ladi bellami had overact her part the word did not ring true thei
jar upon mr fraser much more did thei jar upon angela torn
nerv her pale cheek flush and she turn and spoke but there
wa no anger in her face noth but sorrow that dignifi and
unfathom love lost in it own depth onli the ey seem as
sightless as those of on walk in her sleep
when your hour of dread troubl come as it will come prai god
that there mai be none to mock you as you mock me and she turn
like a stricken thing and went slowli out blindli grope her wai
along
her last word had hit the victor hard who can sai what hidden string
thei touch or what prescienc of evil thei awaken but thei went
nigh to fell her clutch the mantelpiec ladi bellami gasp
for air then recov a littl she said
thank god that is over
mr fraser scarc saw thi last incid so overwhelm wa he at
the sight of angela agoni that he had cover hi face with hi
hand when he lift it again ladi bellami wa gone and he wa
alon
chapter l
three month had pass sinc that aw christma dai angela wa
heartbroken and after the first burst of her despair turn
herself to the onli consol which wa left her it wa not of thi
world
she did not question the truth of the dread new that ladi bellami
had brought her and if ever a doubt did aris in her breast a
glanc at the ring and the letter effectu quell it nor did she
get brainfev or ani other ill her young and healthi frame wa
too strong a citadel to be taken out of hand by sorrow and thi to
her wa on of the most wonder thing in her afflict it had
come and crush her and life still went on much as befor the sun
of her system had fallen and yet the system wa not appreci
derang it wa dread to her to think that arthur wa dead but an
ad sting lai in the fact that she wa not dead too oh how glad
she would have been to die sinc death had becom the gate through
which she need must pass to reach her lover side
for it had been given to angela live so much alon and think so
long and deepli upon these great mysteri of our be to soar to
the height of a nobl faith to the intens puriti of her mind a
live heaven present itself a comfort place veri differ
from the vagu and formularis abstract with which we ar for the
most part satisfi where arthur and her mother were wait to greet
her and where the great light of the godhead would shine around them
all she grew to hate her life the dull barrier of the flesh that
stood between her and her end still she at and drank enough to
support it still dress with the same perfect neat as befor
still live in short as though arthur had not di and the light
and colour had not gone out of her world
on dayit wa in marchsh wa sit in mr fraser studi
read the shakespear which arthur had given to her and in the
woe of other strive to forget her own but the attempt prove a
failur she could not concentr her thought thei would
continu wander awai into space in search of arthur
she wa dress in black from the dai that she heard her lover wa
dead she would wear no other colour and as she gaze with her hand
idli clasp befor her out at the drive sleet and snow mr fraser
thought that he had never seen statu pictur or woman of such
sweet yet majest beauti but it had been filch from the featur
of an immort the spiritlook which at time had visit her from a
child now continu shone upon her face and to the sight of sin
men her ey seem almost aw in their solemn calm and puriti she
smile but seldom now and when she did it wa in those grei ey
that the radianc began her featur scarc seem to move
what ar you think of angela
i am think mr fraser that it is onli fourteen week todai
sinc arthur di and that it is veri like that i shall live
anoth forti or fifti year befor i see him i am onli twentyon
and i am so strong even thi shock ha not hurt me
why should you want to die
becaus all the beauti and light ha gone out of my life becaus i
prefer to trust myself into the hand of god rather than to the tender
merci of the world becaus he is there and i am here and i am
tire of wait
have you no fear of death
i have never fear death and least of all do i fear it now why
the veriest coward would not shrink back when the man she love wa
wait for her and i am not a coward and if i were told that i must
die within an hour i could sai how beauti upon the mountain ar
the feet of him that bringeth good tide that publisheth peac
cannot you understand me if all your life and soul were wrap up in
on person and she di would you not long to go to her
mr fraser made no repli for a while but in hi turn gaze out at the
drift snow sure not more immacul pure than thi woman who
could love with so divin a love at length he spoke
angela do you know that it is wrong to talk so you have no right to
set yourself up against the decre of the almighti in hi wisdom he
is work out end of which you ar on of the instrument who ar
you that you should rebel
no onea grain an atom a windtoss feather but what am i to do
with my life how am i to occupi all the come year
with your abil that is a question easi to answer work write
take the place in scholast or social literatur which i have train
you to fill for you fame and fortun lie in an inkstand your mind
is a golden kei that will open to your sight all that is worth see
in the world and pass you into it most pleasant place you can
becom a famou woman angela
she turn upon him sadli
i had such idea for arthur sake i wish to do someth great
inde i had alreadi form a plan but mr fraser like mani
anoth when i lost my love i lost my ambit too both lie buri
in hi grave i have noth left to work for i do not care for fame
or monei for myself thei would onli have been valuabl to give to
him at twentyon i seem to have done with the world reward and
punish it blank and prize it satisfact and desir
even befor i have learnt what thei ar my hope ar as dull and
leaden as that sky and yet the sun is behind it ye that is my onli
hope the sun is behind it though we cannot see it do not talk to me
of ambit mr fraser i am brokenspirit and my onli ambit is
for rest the rest he give to hi belov
rest angela that is the cry of us all we strive for rest and here
we never find it you suffer but do not think that you ar alon
everybodi suffer in their degre though perhap such as you with
the nerv of your mind bare to the rough of the world weather
feel mental pain the more acut but my dear there ar few realli
refin men and women of sensit organ who have not at time
sent up that prayer for rest ani rest even etern sleep it is the
price thei pai for their refin but thei ar not alon if the
heart cry of everi be who endur in thi great univers could be
collect into a singl prayer that prayer would be thou who made
us in piti give us rest
ye we suffer no doubt all of us and implor a peac that doe
not come we must learn
how black is night when golden dai is done
how drear the blind that hath seen the sun
you can tell me that but tell me you who ar a clergyman and
stronger to stand against sorrow than i how can we win even a partial
peac and draw the sting from suffer if you know a wai howev
hard tell it me for do you know and she put her hand to her head
and a vacant look came into her ey i think that if i have to
endur much more of the anguish which i sometim suffer or get ani
more shock i shall go mad i try to look to the futur onli and to
rise superior to my sorrow and to a certain extent i succe but my
mind will not alwai carri the strain put upon it but fall heavili
to earth like a wing bird then it is that depriv of it higher
food and left to feed upon it own sad and to brood upon the bare
fact of the death of the man i lovedi sometim think as men ar
not often lovedthat my spirit almost break down if you can tell me
ani cure anyth which will bring me comfort i shall inde be
grate to you
i think i can angela if you will no longer devot yourself to
studi you have onli to look round to find anoth answer to your
question as to what you ar to do ar there no poor in these part
for you to visit cannot your hand make cloth to cover those who
have none is there no sick that you can nurs no sorrow that you
can comfort i know that even in thi parish there ar mani home
where your presenc would be as welcom as a sunbeam in winter
rememb angela that grief can be selfish as well as pleasur
you ar right mr fraser you alwai ar right i think i am selfish
in my troubl but it is a fault that i will try to mend inde to
look at it in that light onli my time is of no benefit to myself i
mai as well devot it to other
if you do your labour will bring it own reward for in help
other to bear their load you will wonderfulli lighten your own nor
need you go far to begin why do you not see more of your own father
you ar natur bound to love him yet it is but rare that you
speak to him
my father you know he doe not like me my presenc is alwai a
sourc of irrit to him he cannot even bear me to look at him
oh sure that must be your fanci probabl he think you do not
care about him he ha alwai been a strang and wayward man i know
but you should rememb that he ha had bitter disappoint in
life and try to soften him and win him to other thought do thi and
you will soon find that he will be glad enough of your compani
i will try to do as you sai mr fraser but i confess i have onli
small hope of ani success in that direct have you ani parish work
i can do
nor did the matter end there as is so often the case where parish
work and young ladi ar concern angela set to her charit
duti with a steadi determin that made her servic veri
valuabl she undertook the sole manag of a cloth club in
itself a madden thing to ordinari mortal and had an ey to the
distribut of the parish coal of mother meet and other
cheer parochi entertain she becam the life and soul
give up her mathemat and classic read she took to knit
babi vest and sock instead inde the number of articl which
her nimbl finger turn out in a fortnight wa a pleasant surpris
for the cold toe of the babi and as mr fraser had prophesi
she found that her labour wa of a sort which brought a certain
reward
chapter li
on on point howev angela effort fail complet she could
make no headwai with her father he shrank more than ever from her
societi and at last ask her to oblig him by allow him to follow
hi own path in peac of arthur death he had never spoken to her
or she to him but she knew that he had heard of it
philip had heard of it thu on that christma afternoon he had been
take hi daili exercis when he met ladi bellami return from the
abbei hous the carriag stop and she got out to speak to him
have you been to the abbei hous to pai a christma visit he ask
it is veri kind of you to come and see us so soon after your return
i am the bearer of bad new so i did not loiter
bad new what wa it
mr heigham is dead she answer watch hi face narrowli
dead imposs
he di of enter fever at madeira i have just been to break the
new to angela
oh inde she will be pain she wa veri fond of him you know
ladi bellami smile contemptu
did you ever see ani on put to the extremest tortur if you have
you can guess how your daughter wa pain
philip winc
well i cant help it it is no affair of mine goodby and then
as soon as she wa out of hear i wonder if she li or if she
ha murder him georg must have been put on the screw
into the particular of arthur heigham death or suppos death he
never inquir why should he it wa no affair of hi he had long
ago wash hi hand of the whole matter and left thing to take
their chanc if he wa dead well and good he wa veri sorri for
him if he wa aliv well and good also in that case he would no
doubt arriv on the appoint date to marri angela
but notwithstand all thi unanswer reason he still found
it quit imposs to look hi daughter in the face her ey still
burnt him ay even more than ever did thei burn for her widow
dress and brow were agoni to him and rent hi heart not with remors
but fear but still hi greed kept the upper hand though death by
mental tortur must result yet he would glut himself with hi desir
more than ever he hunger for those wide land which if onli thing
fell out right would becom hi at so ridicul a price decidedli
arthur heigham death wa no affair of hi
about six week befor angela convers with mr fraser which
end in her undertak parish work a rumour had got about that
georg caresfoot had been taken ill veri serious ill it wa said
that a chill had settl on hi lung which had never been veri
strong sinc hi fever and that he had in short gone into a
consumpt
of georg angela had neither seen nor heard anyth for some time
not sinc she receiv the welcom letter in which he relinquish hi
suit she had inde with that natur readi of the human mind
to forget unpleas occurr thought but littl about him of
late sinc her mind had been more fulli occupi with other and more
press thing still she vagu wonder at time if he wa realli
so ill as her father thought
on dai she wa walk home by the path round the lake after pai
a visit to a sick child in the villag when she suddenli came face to
face with her father she expect that he would as usual pass on
without address her and drew to on side of the path to allow him
to do so but to her surpris he stop
where have you been angela
to see ellen mim she is veri ill poor child
you had better be care you will be catch scarlet fever or
somethingther is a great deal about
i am not at all afraid

to you we see so littl of each other
well well i have been to isleworth to see your cousin georg he is
veri ill
you told me that he wa ill some time back what is it that is realli
the matter with him
gallop consumpt he cannot last long
poor man why doe he not go to a warmer climat
i dont knowthat is hi affair but it is a seriou matter for me
if he di under present circumst all the isleworth estat
which ar mine by right must pass awai from the famili forev
why must thei pass awai
becaus your grandfath with a refin ingenu made a provis
in hi will that georg wa not to leav them back to me as he wa
tell me thi afternoon he is anxiou to do if he were to die now
with a will in my favour or without ani will at all thei would all
go to some far awai cousin in scotland
he di of heartdiseas did he notmi grandfath i mean
philip face grew black as night and he shot a quick glanc of
suspicion at hi daughter
i wa sai he went on without answer her question that
georg mai sell the land or settl it but must not leav it to me or
you nor can i take under an intestaci
angela did not understand these legal intricaci and knew about as
much about the law of intestaci as she did of egyptian inscript
well she said consolingli i am veri sorri but it cant be
help can it
the girl is a born fool mutter philip beneath hi breath and
pass on
a week or so afterward just when the primros and lentlili were
at the meridian of their beauti and all the air wa full of song
angela heard more about her cousin georg mr fraser wa on dai sent
for to isleworth ladi bellami brought him the messag sai that
georg wa in such a state of health that he wish to see a
clergyman
i never saw a wors case he said to angela on hi return he doe
not leav the hous but li in a darken room cough and spit
blood he is i should sai go off fast but he refus to see a
doctor hi frame of mind howev is most christian and he seem to
have reconcil himself to the prospect of a speedi releas
poor man said angela sympathet he sent and ask to see
you did he not
welly but when i got there he talk more about the thing of
thi world than of the next he is greatli distress about your
father i daresai you have heard how your cousin georg supplant
your father in the success to the isleworth estat your
grandfath disinherit him you know becaus of hi marriag with
your mother now that he is dy he see the injustic of thi but
is prevent by the term of your grandfath will from restor
the land to your branch of the famili so it must pass to some distant
cousinsat least so i understand the matter
you alwai told me that it is easi to drive a coach and four through
will and settlement and legal thing if he is so anxiou to do so
can he not find a wai out of the difficultyi mean some honour
wai
no i believ not except an imposs on and mr fraser smile a
rather forc smile
what is that ask angela carelessli
well that he shouldshould marri you befor he di at least
you know he sai that that is the onli wai in which he could legal
transfer the estat
angela start and turn pale
then i am afraid the estat will never be transfer how would
that help him
well he sai he could then enter into a nomin sale of the estat
to your father and settl the monei on you
and why could he not do thi without marri me
i dont know i dont understand much about these thing i am not a
busi man but it is imposs for some reason or anoth but of
cours it is absurd good night my dear dont overdo it in the
parish
anoth week pass without ani particular new of georg ill
except that he wa get weaker when on dai ladi bellami appear
at the abbei hous where she had not been sinc that dread
christma dai angela felt quit cold when she saw her enter and her
greet wa as cold as herself
i hope that you bring me no more bad new she said
no angela except that your cousin georg is dy but that is
scarc like to distress you
i am sorri
ar you there is no particular reason why you should be you do not
like him
no i do not like him
it is a piti though becaus i have come to ask you to marri him
upon my word ladi bellami you seem to be the chosen messeng of
everyth that is wretch last time you came to thi hous it wa
to tell me of dear arthur death and now it is to ask me to marri a
man whom i detest i thought that i had told both you and him that i
will not marri him i have gone as near marri as i ever mean to in
thi world
realli angela you ar most unjust to me do you suppos that it wa
ani pleasur to me to have such a sad duti to perform howev it is
refresh to hear you talk so vigor clearli the loss of your
lover ha not affect your spirit
angela winc beneath the taunt but made no repli
but if you will condescend to look at the matter with a singl grain
of commonsens you will see that circumst have utterli chang
sinc you refus to marri georg then mr heigham wa aliv poor
fellow and then too georg want to marri you as a wife now he is
mere anxiou to marri you that he mai be enabl to make repar
to your father he is a fastdi man you would never be hi wife
except in name the grave would be hi onli marriageb do you not
understand the differ
perfectli but do you not understand that whether in deed or in
name i cannot outrag my dead arthur memori by be for an hour the
wife of that man do you not know that the marriag servic requir
a woman to swear to love honour and obei till death part
whether it be a dai or a lifetim awai can i even as a mere form
swear to love when i loath honour when i despis obei when my whole
life would rise in rebellion against obedi what ar these estat
to me that i should do such violenc to my conscienc and my memori
estat of what us ar thei to on whose futur li in the ward of
a hospit or a sisterhood i will have noth to do with thi
marriag ladi bellami
well i must sai angela you do not make much ado about ruin your
father to gratifi your own sentiment whim it must be a comfort
thing to have children to help on in on old ag
angela reflect on mr fraser word about her duti to her father
and for the second time that dai she winc beneath ladi bellami
taunt but as she return no answer her visitor had no altern
but to drop the subject and depart
befor she went howev she had a few word with philip urg the

the follow letter
isleworth hall roxham mai 2
dear cousin angela
my kind and devot friend ladi bellami ha told me that she ha
spoken to you on a subject which is veri near to my heart and
that you have distinctli declin to have anyth to do with it
of cours i know that the matter li entir within your own
discret but i still ventur to lai the follow point befor
you there have i am awar been some pain passag between us
passag which under present circumst had much better be
forgotten so first i ask you to put them quit out of your
mind and to judg of what i have to propos from a veri differ
point of view
i write angela to ask you to marri me it is true sinc
unfortun my health will not allow me to ask you in person
but it is a veri differ offer from that which i made you in the
lane when you so bitterli refus me now i am sole anxiou that
the marriag should take place in order that i mai be enabl to
avoid the stringent provis of your grandfath will which
whilst forbid me to leav these estat back to your father or
hi issu fortun doe not forbid a fictiti sale and the
settlement of the sum or otherwis but i will not troubl you
with these legal detail
in short i supplant your father in youth and i am now anxiou
to make everi repar in my power and at present i am quit
unabl to make ani independ of thi it pain me to think of
the estat pass awai from the old stock and i should like to
know that you who have been the onli woman whom i have felt true
affect for will on dai come into possess of it of cours
as you understand the marriag would be noth but a form and
if as i am told you object to it be gone through with the
ceremoni of the church it could be made equal legal at a
registri offic
but pleas understand angela that i do not wish to press you it
is for you to judg onli you must judg quickli for i am a fast
dy man and am anxiou to get thi matter off my mind on wai
or other in order that i mai be abl to give it fulli to the
consider of subject of more vital import to on in my
condit than marri and give in marriag
ever dear cousin angela
affection your
georg caresfoot
psrememb you have your father to consid in thi matter as
well as yourself
the receipt of thi letter plung angela into the greatest distress
of mind it wa couch in a tone so courteou and so moder that it
carri with it convict of it sincer and truth if she onli had
been concern she would not long have hesit but the idea of her
duti to her father rose up befor her like a cloud what wa her true
duti under the circumst there wa the rub
she took the letter to mr fraser and ask hi advic he read it
carefulli and thought a long while befor he answer the idea of
angela be unit to anybodi in marriag even as a matter of form
wa natur abomin to him but he wa far too honour and
conscienti a man to allow hi person like or dislik to
interfer with whatev he consid to be hi duti but in the end
he found it imposs to give ani fix opinion
my dear he said all that i can suggest is that you should take it
to your father and hear what he ha got to sai after all it is he
who must have your true welfar most at heart it wa into hi hand
that i heard your mother in peculiarli solemn word consign you and
your interest take it to your father dear there is no counsel like
that of a father
had mr fraser been the father thi would doubtless have been true
enough but though he had known him for so mani year and wa privi
to much of hi histori he did not yet understand philip caresfoot
hi own open and guileless natur did not easili suspect evil in
anoth more especi when that other wa the father of her whom he
look upon as the earthli incarn of all that wa holi and pure
angela sigh and obeyedsigh from doubt obei from duti she
hand the letter to philip without a wordwithout a word he read it
i want your opinion father she said i wish to do what is right
you know how pain what ha happen ha been for me you knowor
if you do not know you must have guessedhow complet shatter my
life is as for thi marriag the whole thing is repugn to me
person i had rather sacrific fifti properti than go through
it but i know that i ought to think of other mr fraser tell me
that it is my duti to consult you that you will natur have my
interest most at heart that it wa into your hand and to your care
that my mother consign me on her deathb fatherand she clasp
her hand and look him full in the face with her earnest eyesmr
fraser is right it must be for you to decid i will trust you
entir and leav the burden of decis to your honour and
generos onli i sai spare me if you can
philip rose and went to look out of the window that he might hide the
evid agit of hi face and the tremor of hi limb he felt
that the crucial moment had come all hi poor sophistri all hi
miser shuffl and attempt to fix the respons of hi act
on other had recoil upon hi own head she had come to him and
laid the burden on hi heart what should he answer for a moment the
shadesfor with him thei were onli shadesof good angel gain the
upper hand and he wa about to turn and look her in the facefor
then he felt he could have look her in the faceand bid her have
noth to do with georg and hi propos but even in the act of
turn to obei the impuls hi ey fell upon the roof of isleworth
hall which stand on an emin could easili be seen from the
abbei hous and hi mind quicker than the ey flew to the outlook
place upon that roof where he had so often climb as a boi and
survei the fair champaign countri beyond it meadow and wood fallow
and cornland all of which were for him involv in that answer he
did not stop turn butso quick is the work of the mindh
chang the natur of hi answer the real presenc of the demon of
greed chase awai the poor angel shadow
it would not be much of a sacrific for you angela to go through
thi form he is a dy man and you need not even chang your name
the land ar mine by right and will be your it will break my heart
to lose them after all these year of toil to save enough to bui
them but i do not wish to forc you in short i leav the matter to
your generos as you would have left it to mine
and suppos that i were to marri my cousin georg and he were not to
die after all what would be my posit then you must clearli
understand that to save us all from starvat i would never be hi
wife
you need not troubl yourself with the question he is a dead man in
two month time he will be in the famili vault
she bow her head and left himleft him with hi hot and glow
greed behind which crept a terror

smile

but i told you that i should not fail as i have warn you of what
will follow your success sign thi paperthi wastepaperand
return it
chapter liii
by return of post angela receiv her strang agreement duli copi
and sign and after thi the prepar for the marriag went on
rapidli but where such a larg transact is concern as the sale
of between three and four thousand acr of land copyhold and
freehold togeth with sundri rentcharg and the lordship of six
manor thing cannot be done in a minut
both georg and philip and their respect lawyerssir john would
have noth to do with the matterdid their best to expedit
matter but unfortun some legal difficulti aros in connect
with the transfer and who can hurri the ponder and caprici
machineri of the law
at length it becam clear to all concern except angela that it
would be imposs for the marriag to take place befor the eighth
of june and it also becam clear that that wa the last possibl dai
on which it could take place georg beg philip by letter be
too ill to come and see him to allow the marriag to be gone through
with at onc and have the busi transact finish afterward
but to thi philip would not consent the titlede he said must
be in hi possess befor it took place otherwis he would have no
marriag georg had therefor no option but to accept hi term
when angela wa told of the date fix for the ceremonysh would not
allow the word marriag to be mention in connect with itsh at
first creat consider constern by quietli announc that
she would not have it perform until the tenth of june at last
howev when matter were grow seriou and when she had treat
all the pressur that it wa possibl to put upon her with quiet
indifferencefor as usual her father declin to interfer but
content himself with plai a strictli passiv partsh suddenli
of her own mere motion abolish the difficulti by consent to
appear befor the registrar on the eighth of june as georg wish
her reason for have object to thi date in the first instanc
will be easili guess it wa the dai befor the anniversari of
arthur departur an anniversari which it wa her fanci to dedic
sole to hi memori but as the delai appearedthough she could not
altogeth understand whyto put other to great inconveni and
as georg state of health had becom such as to render postpon
even for a coupl of dai of doubt expedi and as moreov
she decid on reflect that she could better give her thought to
her dead lover when she had gone through with the grim farc that hung
over her she suddenli chang her mind
occasion thei brought her document to sign and she sign them
without a question but on the whole she treat the affair with
consider apathi the truth be that it wa repugn to her
mind which she prefer to occupi with other and veri differ
thought so she let it go she knew that she wa go to do a thing
which wa dread to her becaus she believ it to be her duti but
she comfort herself with the reflect that she wa ampli secur
against all possibl conting by her previou agreement with
georg angela knowledg of the marriagelaw of her countri and of
what constitut a legal document wa not extens
for thi same reason becaus it wa distast she had never said
anyth of her contempl marriag to pigott and it wa quit
unknown in the neighbourhood sinc the miss lee scandal and hi
consequ disinherit nobodi had visit philip caresfoot and
those who took interest in him or hi affair were few inde the
matter had been kept a dead secret but on the seventh of june be
the dai previou to the ceremoni angela went down to her nurs
cottag and told her what wa about to be done suppress howev
from variou motiv all mention of her agreement with georg it
ad to her depress to find that pigott wa unaccount
disturb at the new
well miss she saidlord to think that i shant be abl to
call you that no longeri havent got noth in particular to sai
agin it see that sure enough the man adi as i ha on good
author from my own aunt cousin her that doe the servant
wash up at the hall and mighti bad she doe it beg of her
pardon for the disparag and so he wont troubl you for long
and somehow it do seem as though you hadnt got no choic left in the
matter just as though everybodi and everyth wa aquietli push
you into it but miss somehow i dont like it to be plain a
marriag as aint no marriag aint altogeth natur like and in an
offic too along with a man as you would not touch with a pair of
tong and that man on hi last leg im right down sorri if i make
you feel uncomfort deari but bless me i dont know how it is
but when a thing stick in my mind im as bound to hawk it up as
though it were a bone in my throat
i dont like it ani more than you do nurs but perhap you dont
understand all about the properti be concern and about it
have to pass awai from my father if i dont do thi i care noth
about the properti but he left it to my generos arthur is dead
and he left it to my generos nurs what could i do
well miss your act accord to what you think right and due
to your father which is more nor i doe and poor dead mr arthur up
in heaven there will make a note of that there aint no manner of
doubt and somehow it do seem that thing cant be allow to go wrong
with you my dear see how your asacrif of yourself and of
your wish to benefit other
thi convers did not tend to put angela into better spirit but
she felt that it wa now too late to reced
whilst angela wa talk to pigott sir john and ladi bellami were

devot itself to the derang of their affair and the ingeni
disappoint of their hope but now the vagu dread wa gone
angela wa not spirit awai or dead and to know her aliv wa to
know her faith

the tree surround the abbei hous and between the tree there
glimmer a faint light which might proce from some rise star or
from angela window he prefer to believ it wa the latter the
propinqu made him veri happi what wa she do he wonder
sit by her window and think of him he would ask her on the

it wa full daylight now and the sun never look upon a loveli
morn the air wa warm but there wa that sharp fresh in it
which is need to make summer weather perfect and which we alwai
miss by breakfast at nine oclock the sky wa blue just fleck
with littl cloud the dewdrop sparkl upon everi leaf and blade of

for dinner with such splendour that her maid thought it necessari to
remind her that there wa no compani come

she sat through dinner and afterward went into the drawingroom and
open a despatchbox read and burnt a great number of paper

then from a secret drawer in the despatchbox she extract a littl
phial tightli stopper and sealingwax she examin it close
and look at the liquid in it against the light
my medicin ha taken no harm dure thi twenti year she thought
it still look what it isstrong enough to kill a giant and subtl
enough to leav littl trace upon a child then she shut up the
despatchbox and put it awai and go to the open window look up
at the star and then down at the shadow flung by the cloud as thei

at that moment sam stori wa interrupt by the arriv of a
farmer cart
how be you sam
well i thank yer for seventytwo that is not particular ill
have you a gentleman of the name of heigham stai here
i am he said arthur do you want me
no sir onli the stationmast at roxham ask me to drop thi here
as it wa mark immedi and he hand arthur a box
arthur thank him and take it went up to hi room leav old
sam delight to find a new listen to hi stori of the fire
it wa from the florist and contain the bouquet he had meant to
give angela on her weddingdai it had cost him a good deal of thought
that bouquet to sai noth of five guinea of the coin of the realm
and he felt a certain curios to look at it though to do so gave
him someth of the same sensat that we experi in read a
letter written by some love hand which we know grew cold befor the
line it trace could reach us he took the box to hi room and open
it the bouquet wa a love thing and did credit even to covent
garden and the mass of stephanoi and orangebloom reliev here
and there by rise sprai of liliesofthevallei fill the whole
room with fragranc
he drew it from the zincwel in which it wa pack in moss and
cottonwool and wonder what he should do with it he could not
leav such a thing about nor would he take it awai suddenli an idea
struck him and he repack it in it case as carefulli as he could in
the origin moss and cottonwool and then look about for the sheet
of tissuepap that should complet the cover he had destroi
it and had to search for a substitut in so do hi ey fell upon
a long envelop on hi dressingt and he smile it contain hi
marriag licenc and he bethought him that it wa a veri fair
substitut for tissuepap and quit as worthless he extract it
and place it over the flower close up the box then he carefulli
direct it to mr georg caresfoot abbei hous and ring the
bell desir the boot to find a messeng to take it over
when he had done all thi he sat down and wonder what could have
come to him that he could take pleasur in do a cruel action onli
worthi of a jealou woman
perhap of all the bitter cup which ar held to our lip in thi sad
world there is none more bitter than that which it wa hi lot to
drink of now to begin with the blow fell in youth when we love or
hate or act with an ardour and an entir devot that we give to
noth in afterlif it is then that the heart put forth it most
tender and yet it most lusti shoot and if thei ar crush the
whole plant suffer and sometim bleed to death arthur had to an
extent quit unreal by himself until he lost her centr all hi
life in thi woman and it wa no exagger to sai as he had said
to her that she had murder hi heart and wither up all that wa
best in it she had done more she had inflict the most cruel injuri
upon him that a woman can inflict upon a man she had shaken hi
belief in her sex at larg
he felt sit there in hi desol that now he had lost angela
he could never be the same man he would otherwis have been her cruel
desert had shatter the tint glass through which youth look at
the world and he now befor hi dai saw it as it is grim and hard
and full of coars realiti and did not yet know that time would
again soften down the sharpest of the rough outlin and throw a
garment of it own over the naked of life he wa a gener
heart man and not a vain on and had he thought that angela had
ceas to care for him and love thi other man he could have found
it in hi heart to forgiv her and even to sympath with her but
he could not think thi someth told him that it wa not so she
had contract herself into a shame loveless marriag and to
gain end quit foreign to all love had rais a barrier between them
which had no right to exist and yet on that in thi world could he
thought never be remov
misfortun rain upon us from everi quarter of the sky but so long as
thei come from the sky we can bear them for thei ar beyond the
control of our own volit and must be accept as we accept the
gale or the lightn it is the troubl which spring from our own
folli and weak or from that of those with whom our live ar
intertwin which realli crush us now arthur knew enough of the
world to be awar that there is no folli to equal that of a woman who
of her own free will truli love on man whom she can marri if she
will sit deliber give herself to anoth it is not onli a
folli it is a crime and like most crime for thi life an
irretriev mistak
long befor he got back to london the first unwholesom exalt of
mind that alwai follow a great misfortun and which mai perhap be
compar with the excit that for awhil cover the shame sens
of defeat in an armi had evapor and he began to realiz the
crush aw of the blow which had fallen on him and to fear
lest it should drive him mad he look round hi littl horizon for
some straw of comfort at which to catch and could find none noth
but dread thought and sicken vision
and then suddenli just as he wa sink into the dul of despair
there came like the fist gleam of light in chaotic dark the
memori of mildr carr truli she had spoken prophet hi idol
had been utterli cast down and crush to powder by a hand stronger
than hi own he would go to her in hi suffer perhap she could
find mean to comfort him
when he reach town he took a hansom and went to look for some room
he would not return to those he had left on the previou afternoon
for the sympathet landlord had help him to pack up the wed
cloth and had admir the wed gift arthur felt that he could
not face him again he found some to suit him in duke street st
jame and left hi thing there thenc he drove to fenchurch street
and took a passag to madeira the clerk the same on who had given
him hi ticket about a year befor rememb him perfectli and
ask him how he got on with mr carr but when hi passag wa taken
he wa disgust to find that the mail did not sail for anoth five
dai he look at hi watch it wa onli halfpast on oclock he
could scarc believ what had happen had onli occur that
morn onli seven hour ago it seem to him that he had stood face
to face with angela not that morn but year ago and mile awai
on some desol shore which lai on the other side of a dead ocean of
pain and yet it wa onli seven hour if the hour went with such
heavi wing how would the dai pass and the month and the year
what should he do with himself in hi condit perpetu activ
wa as necessari to him as air he must do someth to dull the sharp
edg of hi suffer or the sword of mad which hung over him by
such a slender thread would fall suddenli he bethought him of a man
whom he had known slightli up at cambridg a man of wealth and evil
reput thi man would he felt be abl to put him in a wai of
get through hi time he knew hi address and thither he drove
four dai later a figur shrunk shaki and look prematur old
with the glaze of intox scarc fade from hi ey walk
into mr borlei offic that respect gentleman look and look
again
good heaven he said at length it isnt arthur heigham
ye it is though said an unequ voic iv come for some
monei iv got none left and i am go to madeira tomorrow

have been expect to see your marriag in the paper why it onli
a few dai ago that you left to be marri

noth to speak of you know but i had rather not talk about it if
you dont mind im like a nag with a flai back dont like the
sight of the saddl at present and poor arthur mental and
physic exhaust put hi head down on hi arm and gulp
the old lawyer took in the situat at a glanc
hard hit he said to himself and gone on to the burst and then
aloud well well that ha happen to mani a man in fact you
mightnt believ it but it onc happen to me and i dont look much
the wors do i but we wont talk about it the less said of a bad
busi the better that my maxim and so you ar go abroad
again have you got ani friend at madeira
arthur nod
and you want some more monei let me see i sent you 200 pound last
week
that wa for my wed tour iv spent it now you can guess how i
have spent it pleasant contrast isnt it give rise to moral
reflect
come come heigham you must not give wai like that these thing
happen to most men in the cours of their live and if thei ar wise
it teach them that gingerbread isnt all gilt and to set down women
at their proper valu and appreci a good on if it pleas
provid to give them on in cours of time dont you go make a
fool of yourself over thi girl pretti face handsom is as handsom
doe these thing ar hard to bear i know but you dont make them
ani better by pitch your own reput after a girl want of
stabil
i know that you ar quit right and i am much oblig to you for
your kind advic but we wont sai anyth more about it i suppos
that you can let me have some monei
oh ye if you want it though i think we shall have to overdraw
what do you want two hundr here is the chequ
i am anxiou about that young fellow said mr borlei to himself in
the paus between arthur departur and the entri of the next client
i hope hi disappoint wont send him to the dog he is not of
the sort who take it easi like i did for instanc dear me that is
a long while ago now i wonder what the detail of hi littl affair
were and who the girl marri captain shuffl ye show him in
chapter lxii
next morn arthur cash hi chequ and start on hi travel he
had no veri clear idea why he wa go back to madeira or what he
meant to do when he got there but then at thi pain stage of hi
exist none of hi idea could be call clear though he did not
realiz it what he wa search for wa sympathi femal sympathi of
cours for in troubl member of either sex gravit instinct
to the other for comfort perhap thei do not quit trust their own
or perhap thei ar afraid of be laugh at
arthur wa not on of those natur that can lock their grief
within the bosom and let them lie there till in process of time thei
shrivel awai except among member of the peerag as pictur in
current literatur these stern proud creatur ar not common man
whether he figur in the world as a peer or a hedgecarpent is as
a matter of fact mental as well as physic gregari and
advers to loneli either in hi joi or sorrow
decidedli too the homoeopath system must be found on great
natur fact and there is philosophi born of the observ of
human natur in the somewhat vulgar proverb that recommend a hair
of the dog that bit you otherwis nine men out of everi ten who
have been badli treat or think that thei have been badli treat
by a woman would not at onc rush headlong for refug to anoth a
proceed which also in nine case out of ten end in make
confus wors confound
arthur though he wa not awar of it wa exemplifi a natur law
that ha not yet been properli explain but even if he had known
it it is doubt if the knowledg would have made him ani happier
for it is irrit to reflect that we ar the slave of natur
law that our action is not the outcom of our own volit but of a
vagu forc work silent as the gulf streamsinc such knowledg
make a man measur hi weak and so strike at hi tenderest
point hi vaniti
but whilst we have been reflect togeth my reader and i arthur
wa make hi wai to madeira so we mai as well all come to a halt
off funchal
veri shortli after the vessel had drop her anchor arthur wa
greet by hi friend the manag of mile hotel
glad to see you sir though i cant sai that you look well i
scarc expect to find anybodi for us at thi time of year
busi is veri slack in the summer

no she is still here she ha not been awai thi year but she ha
been veri quiet no parti or anyth which make peopl think that
she ha lost monei
by thi time the boat wa rise on the roll of the last billow to be
caught next moment by a dozen hand and drag up the shingl it
wa even or rather verg that wai and from under the magnolia
tree below the cathedr there came the sound of the band summon
the inhabit of funchal to congreg chatter and flirt
i think said arthur that i will ask you to take my thing up to
the hotel i will come byandbi i should like the same room i had
befor if it is empti
veri good mr heigham you will have the place nearli all to
yourself now
have seen hi baggag depart arthur turn and resist the
importun of beggar guid and parrotsel who had not yet
recogn him as an old hand made hi wai toward the quinta carr
how well he knew the street and hous even to the wither face of
the women who sat by the door and yet he seem to have grown old
sinc he had seen them ten minut of sharp walk brought him to
the gate of the quinta and he paus befor them and thought how a
few month ago he had quit them miser at the grief of
anoth now to reenter them utterli crush by hi own
he walk on through the beauti garden to the hous the halldoor
stood open he did not wait to ring but driven by some impuls
enter after the glare of the sun which at that time of the year
wa power even in it declin the carefulli shade hall seem
quit dark but by degre hi ey adapt themselv to the alter
light and began to distinguish the familiar outlin of the furnitur
next thei travel to the door of the drawingroom where anoth
sight await them for there herself a perfect pictur stand in
the doorwai for a frame her hand outstretch in welcom and a
love smile upon her lip wa mildr
i wa wait for you she said gentli i thought that you would
come
mildr my idol ha been cast down and as you told me to do i
have come back to you
dear she answer you ar veri welcom
and then came miss terri pleas with all her honest heart to see
him and utterli ignor of the fierc current that swept under the
smooth surfac of their littl social sea miss terri wa not by
natur a keen observ
dear me mr heigham who would have thought of see you again so
soon you ar brave to cross the bai so often her thought ran a
great deal on the bai of biscai but i dont think you look quit
well you have such black line under your ey and i declar
there a grei hair
oh i assur you your favourit bai wa enough to turn anybodi hair
grei miss terri
and so talk cheerfulli thei went in to the pleasant littl
dinner mildr lean over so slightli on hi arm and gaze into
hi sad face with full and happi ey after all that he had gone
through it seem to arthur as though he had drop into a haven of
rest
see here said mildr when thei rose from tabl a wonder ha
come to pass sinc you desert us look sceptic that you ar and
she led him to the window and lift a glass shade which protect
a flowerpot show him a green spike peep from the soil
what is that
what is itwhi it is the mummi hyacinth which you declar that we
should never see blossom in thi world it ha bud whether or not
it will blossom who can sai
it is an omen he said with a littl laugh and for the first time
that even their ey met
come into the garden and you can smoke on the museum verandah it is
pleasant there these hot night
it is danger your garden
she laugh softli you have prove yourself superior to danger
then thei pass out togeth the even wa still and veri sultri
not a breath stir the silenc of the night the magnolia the moon
flower and a thousand other bloom pour out their fragranc upon
the surround air where it lai in rich patch like perfum thrown
on water a thin mist veil the sea and the littl wavelet struck
with a sorrow sound against the rock below
tell me all about it arthur
she had settl herself upon a long low chair and as she leant back
the starlight glanc white upon her arm and bosom
there is not much to tell it is a common storyat least i believ
so she threw me over and the dai befor i should have marri her
marri anoth man
well
well i saw her the morn follow her marriag i do not rememb
what i said but i believ i spoke what wa in my mind she faint
and i left her
ah you spoke harshli perhap
spoke harshli now that i have had time to think of it i wish that i
could have had ten imagin to shape my thought and ten tongu
to speak them with do you understand what thi woman ha done she
ha sold herself to a bruteoh mildr such a brutesh ha
desert me for a man who is not even a gentleman
perhap she wa forc into it
forcednonsens we ar not in the middl ag a good woman should
have been forc to drown herself befor she consent to commit such
a sacrileg against herself as to marri a man she hate but she my
love my dove my undefiledsh whom i thought whiter than the snow
she could do thi and do it deliber i had rather have seen
her dead and myself dead with her
dont you take a rather exagger view arthur dont you think
perhap that some of the fault li with you for overr women
believ me so far as my experi goe and i have seen a good mani
the major of them do not possess the exalt puriti of mind you and
mani veri young men attribut to them thei ar on the contrari for
the most part quit readi to exercis a wise discret in the matter
of marriag even when the feebl tendenc which repres their
affect point anoth wai a littl pressur goe a long wai with
them thei ar alwai glad to make the most of it it is the dust thei
throw up to hide their retreat your angela for instanc wa no
doubt and probabl still is veri fond of you you ar a charm
young man with nice ey and a take wai with women and she would
veri much have like to marri you but then she also like her
cousin estat she could not have both and be forc to
choos she chose the latter you should take a commonsens view of
the matter you ar not the first who ha suffer women especi
young women who do not understand the valu of affect must be
veri much in love befor thei submit to the selfsacrific that is
suppos to be characterist of them and what men talk of as stain
upon them thei do not consid as such thei know if thei know
noth els that a good incom and an establish will make them
perfectli clean in the opinion of their own small worlda littl
world of sham and form that care noth for the spirit of the
moral law provid the letter is act up to it is by thi that thei
mark their standard of person virtu not by the high rule you men
imagin for them there is no social fuller soap so effectu as
monei and posit
you speak like a book and give your own sex a high charact tell
me then would you do such a thing
i arthur how can you ask me i had rather be torn to piec by wild
hors i spoke of the major of the women not of them all
ah and yet she could do it and i thought her better than you
i do not think that you should speak bitterli of her arthur i think
that you should be sorri for her
sorri for her why
becaus from what i have gather about her she is not quit an
ordinari young woman howev badli she mai have treat you she is a
person of refin feel and suscept is it not so
without a doubt
well then you should piti her becaus she will bitterli expiat
her mistak for myself i do not piti her much becaus i will not
wast my sympathi on a fool for to my mind the woman who could do
what she ha done and deliber throw awai everyth that can
make life realli worth live to us women is a most contempt
fool but you love her and therefor you should be sorri for her
but why
becaus she is a woman who at oneandtwenti ha buri all the
higher part of life who ha of her own act for ever depriv
herself of joi that noth els can bring her love true love is
almost the onli express of which we women ar capabl of all the
nobler instinct and vagu yearn after what is higher and better
than the thing we see and feel around us when we love most and love
happili then we ar at our topmost bent and soar further abov the
earth than anyth els can carri us consequ when a woman is
faithless to her love which is the purest and most honour part of
her the veri best thing to which she can attain she clip her wing
and can fly no more but must be toss like a crippl gull hither
and thither upon the stormi surfac of her littl sea of cours i
speak of women of the higher stamp mani perhap most will feel
noth of all thi in a littl while thei will grow content with
their dull round and the alien natur which thei have mate with and
in their children and their petti care and dissip will forget
that thei possess a higher part if inde thei do possess it like
everyth els in the world thei find their level but with women
like your angela it is anoth thing for them time onli serv to
increasingli unveil the medusahead truth till at last thei see it
as it is and their heart turn to stone back with a sick long
to see a face that is gone from them thei becom lost spirit
wander everlastingli in the empti thei have chosen and find
no rest even her children will not consol her
arthur utter a smother exclam
dont start arthur you must accustom yourself to the fact that
that woman ha pass awai from you and is as complet the person
properti of anoth man as that chair is mine but there the
subject is a pain on to you shall we chang it
it is on that you seem to have studi pretti deepli
ye becaus i have realiz it import to a woman for some
year i have long to be abl to fall in love and when at last i did
so arthur and here her voic grew veri soft it wa with a man who
could care noth for me such ha been my unlucki chanc that a
woman herself belov and herself worthili belov could throw her
bless opportun awai is to me a thing inconceiv and that
arthur is what your angela ha done
chapter lxiii

chapter lxvii
public feel in marlshir wa much excit about the caresfoot

convers as these two event gave rise to we mai be sure that the
godsend wa duli appreci inde the whole stori is up to thi
hour a favourit subject of convers in those part
of cours the member of the polit societi of the neighbourhood of
roxham were divid into two camp the men all thought that angela
had been shamefulli treat the elder and most intens respect
ladi for the most part inclin to the other side of the question
it not be their habit to look at matter from the same point of
view in which thei present themselv to a man nicer sens of
honour thei could see no great harm in georg caresfoot stratagem
a man so rich thei argu wa perfectli entitl to bui hi wife
the marriag had been arrang like their own on the soundest
properti basi and the woman who rose in rebellion against a husband
mere becaus she love anoth man or some such romant nonsens
deserv all she got gone mad had shewel it wa a warn and
these aristocrat matron snif and turn up their nose thei
felt that angela by go mad and creat a public excit had
enter a mute protest against the recogn rule of marriag sale
andbart as practis in thi countryand zululand have
daughter to dispos of thei resent thi and poor angela wa for
year afterward spoken of among them as that immor girl
but the lower and more human strata of societi did not sympath with
thi feel on the contrari thei were all for angela and the dog
aleck who wa suppos to have chock that carroti warmint georg
the inquest on georg bodi wa held at roxham and wa the object of
the greatest possibl interest inde the public excit wa so
great that the coron wa perhap insens influenc by it and
allow the inquiri to travel a littl beyond it profess object of
ascertain the actual caus of death with the result that mani of
the detail of the wick plot from which angela had been the
princip suffer becam public properti needless to sai that thei
did not sooth the feel of an excit crowd when philip after
spend on of the worst halfhour of hi life in the witnessbox
at length escap with such shred of reput as he had hitherto
possess altogeth torn off hi back hi greet from the mob
outsid the court mai fairli be describ as a warm on as the
wit door close behind him he found himself at on end of a
long lane that wa hedg on both side by face not without a touch
of feroc about them and with difficulti kept clear by the
avail forc of the five roxham policemen
who sold hi daughter shout a great fellow in hi ear
let me come there a dear man and have a look at juda said a
skinni littl woman with a squint to an individu who block her
view
the crowd caught at the word juda it shout go and hang
yourself juda juda
how philip got out of that he never quit knew but he did get out
somehow
meanwhil sir john bellami wa be examin in court and
notwithstand the almost aggress innoc of hi appear he
wa not have a veri good time it chanc that he had fallen into
the hand of a rival lawyer who hate him like poison and had good
reason to hate him it is wonder by the wai how enemi do spring
up round a man in troubl like dog who bite a wound companion to
death and on the same principl he is defenceless thi gentleman
would insist on conduct the wit examin on the basi
that he knew all about the fraud practis with refer to the
suppos death of arthur heigham now it will be rememb that sir
john in hi last interview with ladi bellami had declar that there
wa no tittl of evid against him and that it would be imposs
to implic him in the exposur that must overtak her to a certain
extent he wa right but on on point he had overshot himself for at
that veri inquest mr fraser state on oath that he mr fraser had
spoken of arthur heigham death in the presenc of sir john bellami
and had not been contradict
in vain did sir john protest that mr fraser must be mistaken both
the juri and the public look at the probabl of the matter
and though hi protest were accept in silenc when he left
the witnessbox there wa not a man in court but wa moral certain
that he had been privi to the plot and so far as reput wa
concern he wa a ruin man and yet legal there wa not a jot of
evid against him but public opinion requir that a scapegoat
should be found and it wa now hi lot to figur as that unlucki
anim
by the time he reach the exit into the street the impress that
he had had a hand in the busi had in some mysteri wai
commun itself to the mob outsid mani a member of which had
some old grudg to settl with lawyer bellami if onli chanc put an
opportun in their wai as he step through the door utterli
ignor of the greet which await him hi ear were assail by
an aw yell follow by a storm of hoot and hiss
sir john turn pale and look for a mean of escap but the
policeman who had let him out had lock the door behind him and all
round him wa the angri mob
here come the that start the swim roar a voic as soon
as there wa a momentari lull
gentlemen pipe sir john with all the pippin hue gone from hi
cheek and rub hi white hand togeth nervous
yah he poison hi own poor wife shout a woman with a babi
ladi went on sir john in agon tone
pelt him yell a sweet littl boi of ten or so suit the action
to the word and plant a rotten egg full upon sir john impos
brow
no no said the woman who had nicknam philip juda why dont
you drop him in the pond there onli two feet of water and it
soft fall on the mud you can pelt him afterward
the idea wa receiv with acclam and notwithstand hi own
effort to the contrari back as thei were by those of the five
policemen befor he knew where he wa sir john found himself be
hustl by a lot of sturdi fellow toward the filthi duckpond like
an aristocrat to the guillotin thei soon arriv and then follow
the most pain experi of all hi life on of which the veri
thought would ever afterward move him most profoundli two strong
men utterli heedless of hi yell and lament took him by the
heel and two yet stronger than thei caught him by hi plump and
tender wrist and then under the direct of the woman with the
squint thei began to swing him from side to side as soon as the ladi
directress consid that the impetu wa suffici she said
now and awai he went like a swallow onli to land when hi fly
power were exhaust plump in the middl of the duckpond
some ten second afterward a pillar of slimi mud aros and stagger
toward the bank where a crowd of littl boi each hold someth

bellami oh about the same she is a strang woman she never
complain and rare speaksthough twice i have heard her break out
shockingli there will never be ani altern in her case till the
last alter goodby i will look round tomorrow
after thi angela recoveri wa compar speak rapid
though of cours the effect of so sever a shock to the nervou
system could not be shaken off in a dai though she wa no longer mad
she wa still in a disturb state of mind and subject to strang
dream or vision on in particular that visit her sever night
in a success made a great impress upon her
first it would seem to her that she wa wide awak in the middl of
the night and there would creep over her a sens of unmeasur space
infinit silenc and intens solitud she would think that she wa
stand on a dai at the end of a vast hall down which ran endless
row of pillar support an inki sky which wa the roof there wa
no light in the hall yet she could clearli see there wa no sound
but she could hear the silenc onli a soft radianc shone from her
ey and brow she wa not afraid though lone but she felt that
someth would present come to make an end of solitud and so she
stood for mani year or agessh could not tell whichtri to
fathom the mysteri of that great place and watch the light that
stream from her forehead strike upon the marbl floor and pillar
or thread the dark like a shoot star onli to reveal new depth
of black beyond those it pierc at length there came softli
fall from the skyroof which never stir to ani pass breez a
flake of snow larger than a dove wing but it wa bloodr and in
it centr shone a wonder light that made it passag through the
dark a track of glori as it pass gentli downward without
sound she thought that it threw the shadow of a human face it lit
upon the marbl floor and the red snow melt there and turn to
blood but the light that had been it heart shone on pure and steadi
look up again she saw that the vault abov her wa thick with
thousand upon thousand of these flake each glow like a crimson
lamp and each throw it own shadow on of the shadow wa like
georg and she shudder as it pass and ever as thei touch the
marbl pavement the flake melt and becam blood and some of the
light went out but the most part burnt on till at length there wa
no longer ani floor but a deadsea of blood on which float a myriad
point of fire
and then it all grew clear to her for a voic in her mind spoke and
said that thi wa on of god storehous for human soul that the
light wa the soul and the red in the snow which turn to blood wa
the sin which had dure it earthli passag stain it first
puriti the sea of blood befor her wa the sum of the scarlet
wicked of her ag from everi soul there came some to swell it
aw water
at length the red snow ceas to fall and a sound that wa not a
voic but yet spoke peal through the silenc ask if all were
readi the voic that had spoken in her mind answer no he ha not
come who is to see then look upward she saw mile on mile
awai a bright be with halfshut wing flash fast toward her
and she knew that it wa arthur and the loneli left her he lit a
breath radianc by her side and again the great sound peal let
in the live water and cleans awai the sin of thi gener
it echo and di awai and there follow a tumult like the flow of
an angri sea a mighti wind swept past her and after it an ocean of
molten crystal came rush through the illimit hall the sea and
the wind purg awai the blood and put out the lamp leav behind
them a glow of light like that upon her brow and where the lamp had
been stood myriad of seraph be whilst from ten thousand
tongu ran forth a paean of celesti song
then everyth vanish and deep gloom that wa not howev dark
to her settl round them take arthur by the hand she spread her
white wing and circl upward far far thei sail till thei
reach a giant peak that split space in twain here thei alight
and watch the mass of cloud tear through the gulf on either
side of them and look beyond and below gaze upon the shine
world that peopl space beneath them
from the clouddrift to the right and left came a nois as of the
sough of mani wing but thei did not know what caus it till
present the vapour lift and thei saw that alongsid of and
beneath them two separ stream of soul were pass on
outstretch pinion on stream that to their left proceed to
their earthli home and on that to the right return from them
those who went wore grief upon their shadowi face and had sad
colour wing but those who return seem for the most part happi
and their wing were tip with splendour
the neverend stream that came flow from a faroff glori and
that which return have pass the divid cliff on which thei
stood wa chang into a multitud of the red snowflak with the
glow heart and drop gentli downward
so thei stood in happi peac never tire from millennium to
millennium thei watch new world collect out of chao thei saw
them speed upon their high aerial cours till grown hoari their
foundationrock crumbl with ag thei wast awai into the
vast whenc thei had gather to be replac by fresh creation
that in their turn took form teem with life wax wane and
vanish
at length there came an end and the sough of wing wa silent for
ever no more soul went downward and none came up from the earth
then the distant glori from which the soul had come move toward
them with aw mutter and robe in lightn and space wa
fill with spirit on of whom sweep past them cri with a
loud voic children time is dead now is the begin of
knowledg and she turn to arthur who had grown more radiant than
the star which gleam upon hi forehead and kiss him
then she would wake
time pass on and gradual health and strength came back to angela
till at last she wa as power in mind andif that were possibl
except that she wa shorn of her love hair more beauti in bodi
than she had been befor her troubl overwhelm her of arthur she
thought a great dealinde she thought of littl els but it wa
with a sort of hopeless that preclud action nobodi had
mention hi name to her as it wa thought wiser not to do so
though pigott and mr fraser had in as gentl term as thei could
command told her of the detail of the plot against her and of the
consequ to the princip actor in it nor had she spoken of him
it seem to her that she had lost him for good that he could never
come back to her after she had pass that he must hate her too much
she suppos that in act as he did he wa awar of all the
circumst of her marriag and could find no excus for her she
did not even know where he wa and in her ignor of the us of
privat detect and advertis had no idea how to find out
and so she suffer in silenc and onli saw him in her dream
she still stop at the vicarag with pigott nor had there as yet
been ani talk of her return to the abbei hous inde she had not
seen her father sinc the dai of her marriag but now that she had
recov she felt that someth must be done about it wonder
what it should be she on afternoon walk to the churchyard where
she had not been sinc her ill and onc there made her wai
natur to her mother grave she wa move veri quietli and had
almost reach the tree under which hilda caresfoot lai when she
becam awar that there wa alreadi somebodi kneel by the grave
with hi head rest against the marbl cross
it wa her father her shadow fall upon him he turn and saw her
and thei stood look at each other she wa shock at the dread
alter in hi face it wa now that of an old man nearli worn out
with suffer he put hi hand befor hi ey and said
angela how can i face you least of all here
for a moment the memori of her bitter wrong swell in her heart for
she now to a great extent understood what her father part in the
plot had been and she regard him in silenc
father she said present i have been in the hand of god and
not in your and though you have help to ruin my life and have
veri nearli driven me into a madhous i can still sai let the past

chapter lxix
and so on the follow dai angela and pigott return to the abbei
hous but thei both felt that it wa a sad homecom inde if
there had been no other caus for melancholi the sight of philip
face wa enough to excit it in the most happymind person not that
angela saw much of him howev for thei still kept to their old
habit of not live togeth all dai her father wa shut up in hi
room transact busi that had refer to the access of hi
properti and the settlement of georg affair for hi cousin had
di intest so he took hi personalti and wound up the estat as
heiratlaw at night howev he would go out and walk for mile
and in all weathersh seem to dread spend the dark hour at

when angela had been back about a month in the old place she
accident got a curiou insight into her father mental

be much oppress by sorrow thought she thought that she would
read the hour awai but the particular book she want to find wa

passag howev anyth is better than sleepless and the
tyranni of sad thought and empti long so throw on her
dressinggown she took a candl and set off think as she went
how she had in the same guis fled befor her husband
she got her book and wa return when she saw that there wa still
a light in her father studi and that the door wa ajar at that
moment it so happen that an unusu sharp draught come down on
of the passag of the rambl old hous caught her candl and
extinguish it make her wai to the studydoor she push it open
to see if anybodi wa there previou to ask for a light at first
she could see nobodi on the tabl which wa cover with paper
there stood two candl a brandybottl and a glass she wa just
move to the candl to get a light when her ey fell on what she at
first believ to be a heap of cloth huddl togeth on the floor
in the corner of the room further examin show that it wa a
mansh could distinctli see the back of hi hand her first idea
wa that she had surpris a thief and she stop feel
frighten and not know what to do just then the bundl
straighten itself a littl and drop it hand reveal to her
wonder gaze her own father face which wore the same aw look
of abject fear which she had seen upon it when he pass through the
hall beneath her just befor isleworth broke into flame on the night
of her marriag the ey appear to be start from the socket in
an effort to clearli realiz an undefin horror the hair now
daili grow greyer wa partial erect and the pallid lip half
open as though to speak word that would not come he saw her too
but did not seem surpris at her presenc cover up hi ey again
with on hand he shrank further back into hi corner and with the
other point to a larg leather armchair in which pigott had told
her her grandfath had di
look there he whisper hoars
where father i see noth

angela stood aghast she wa alarm in defianc of her own reason
and began to catch the contagion of superstit

matter

thi time of night pass me that bottl and he took nearli half a
tumbler of raw brandi there i am quit right again now i had a bad
attack of indigest that is all good night
angela went without a word she understood now what her father had
meant when he said that he wa accurs but she could not help
wonder whether the brandi had anyth to do with hi
indigest
on the follow dai the doctor came to see her it struck angela that
he came often than wa necessari the fact be that he would
gladli have attend her grati all year round a doctor doe not
often get the chanc of visit such a patient

inquir dure her illnessdrov past in an open carriag and pair
and she saw a gentleman on the front seat whisper someth to the

pigott went into the housekeep room and angela wa at onc shown
up into the drawingroom the servant announc her name to a black
robe figur ly on a sofa and close the door
come here angela caresfoot said a wellknown voic and see how
fate ha repaid the woman who tri to ruin you
she advanc and look at the deathli face still as darkli beauti
as ever on which wa fix that strang look of wild expect that
it had worn when it owner took the poison
ye look at me think what i wa and then what i am and learn how
the spirit of evil pai those who serv him i thought to kill myself
but death wa deni me and now i live as you see me i am an outcast
from the societi of my kindnot that i ever care for that except to
rule it i cannot stir hand or foot i cannot write i can scarc
read i cannot even die my onli resourc is the bitter sea of thought
that seeth etern in thi stricken frame like fire pent in the
womb of a volcano ye angela caresfoot and like the fire too
sometim it overflow and then i can blasphem and rave aloud till
my voic fail that is the onli power which is left to me
angela utter an exclam of piti
pitydo not piti me i will not be piti by you mock me if you
will it is your turn now you prophesi that it would come now it
is here
at ani rate you ar still comfort in your own hous said
angela nervous anxiou to chang the subject and not know what
to sai
oh ye i have monei enough if that is what you mean my husband
threaten to leav me destitut but fear of public opinionand i
hear that he ha run awai and is not well thought of nowor perhap
of myself crippl as i am caus him to chang hi mind but do not
let us talk of that poor creatur i sent for you here for a purpos
where is your lover
angela turn pale and trembl
what do you not know or ar you tire of him
tire of him i shall never be tire of him but he ha gone
shall i tell you where to find him
you would not if you could you would deceiv me again
no oddli enough i shall not i have no longer ani object in do
so when i wa bent upon marri you to georg caresfoot i lash
myself into hate you now i hate you no longer i respect you
inde i have done so all along
then why did you work me such a bitter wrong
becaus i wa forc to believ me or not as you will i am not
go to tell you the storyat ani rate not now i can onli repeat
that i wa forc to
where is arthur
in madeira do you rememb onc tell me that you had onli to lift
your handsoah i forgot i cannot lift mineto draw him back to
you that no other woman in the world could keep him from you if you
chose to bid him come
ye i rememb
then if you wish to get him back you had better exercis your
power for he ha gone to anoth woman
who is she what is she like
she is a young widowa mr carr she is desper in love with
himveri beauti and veri rich
beauti how do you mean tell me exactli what she is like
she ha brown ey brown hair a love complexion and a perfect
figur
angela glanc rapidli at her own reflect in the glass and sigh
then i fear that i shall have no chanc against hernon
you ar a fool if you were alon in the same room with her nobodi
would see her for look at you
angela sigh again thi time from relief
but there is wors than that veri possibl he ha marri her
ah then it is all over
why if he love you as much as you think you can bring him back to
you marri or unmarri
perhap ye i think i could but i would not
why if he love you and you love him you have a right to him among
all the sham and fiction that we call law there is onli on true
the law of natur by virtu of which you belong to each other
no there is a higher lawth law of duti by mean of which we try
to curb the impuls of natur the woman who ha won him ha a right
to consider
then to gratifi a foolish prejudic you ar prepar to lose him
forev
no ladi bellami if i thought that i wa to lose him for ever i
might be tempt to do what is wrong in order to be with him for a
time but i do not think that i onli lose him for a time that i mai
gain him for ever in thi world he is separ from me in the
world to come my right will assert themselv and we shall be
togeth and never part ani more
ladi bellami look at her wonderingli for her ey could still
express her emot
you ar a fine creatur she said and if you believ that
perhap it will be true for you sinc faith must be the measur of
realiz but after all he mai not have marri her that will be
for you to find out
how can i find out
by write to him of courseto the care of mr carr madeira that
is sure to find him
thank you how can i thank you enough
it seem to me that you ow me few thank you ar alwai foolish
about what tend to secur your own happi or you would have
thought of thi befor
there wa a paus and then angela rose to go
ar you go ye go i am not fit compani for such as you perhap
we shall not meet again but in think of all the injuri that i
have done you rememb that my punish is proportion to my sin
thei tell me that i mai live for year
angela gaze at the splendid wreck beneath her and an infinit piti
swell in her gentl heart stoop she kiss her on the forehead
a wild astonish fill ladi bellami great dark ey
child child what ar you do you do not know what i am or you
would not kiss me
ye ladi bellami she said quietli i do that is i know what
you have been but i want to forget that perhap you will on dai be
abl to forget it too i do not wish to preach but perhap after
all thi terribl misfortun mai lead you to someth better thank
god there is forgiv for us all
her word touch some forgotten chord in the stricken woman heart
and two big tear roll down the frozen cheek thei were the first
ann bellami had wept for mani a dai
your voic she said ha a music that awak the echo from a
time when i wa good and pure like you but that time ha gone for
ever
sure ladi bellami the heart that can rememb it can also strive
to reach anoth like it if you have descend the cliff whenc those
echo spring into a vallei howev deep there is still anoth
cliff befor you that you mai climb
it is easi to descend but we need wing to climb look at me
angela my bodi is not more crippl and shorn of power than my dark
spirit is of wing how can i climb
angela bent low besid her and whisper a few word in her ear then
rose with a shy blush upon her face ladi bellami shut her ey
present she open them again
do not speak ani more of thi to me now she said i must have
time the instinct of year cannot be brush awai in a dai if you
knew all the sin i have commit perhap you would think too that
for such as i am there is no forgiv and no hope
whilst there is life there is hope and as i onc heard mr fraser
sai the real kei to forgiv is the desir to be forgiven
again ladi bellami shut her ey and thought and when she drew up
their heavi lid angela saw that there wa someth of a peac
look about them
stand so she said to angela there where the light fall upon your
face that will do now shall i tell you what i read there on your
forehead sit resolut power to grasp and almost measureless capac
to imagin in your ey there is a sympathi not to be guess by
be of a coarser fibr those ey could look at heaven and not be
dazzl your whole face speak of a puriti and singleminded
which i can read but cannot understand your mind reject the
glitter bubbl that men follow and seek the solid truth your
spirit is in tune with thing of light and air it can float to the
extremest height of our mental atmospher and thenc can almost gaze
into the infinit beyond pure but not cold thirst for a wider
knowledg and at time breath the air of a higher world resolut
but patient proud and yet humbl to learn holi but aspir
consciou of gift you do not know how to us girl you rise as near
to what is divin as a mortal mai i have alwai thought so now i am
sure of it
ladi bellami
hush i have a reason for what i sai i do not ask you to wast time
by listen to senseless panegyr listen i will tell you what i
have never told to a live soul befor for year i have been a
student of a lore almost forgotten in thi countrya lore which onc
fulli acquir will put the power that lie hid in natur at the
command of it possessor that will even enabl him to look beyond
natur and perhap so far as the durat of exist is concern
for awhil to triumph over it that lore you can learn though it
baffl me my intellect and determin enabl me to find the cue
to it and to stumbl on some of it secret but i could not follow
them too late i learnt that onli the good and pure can do that much
of the result of year of toil i destroi the other night but i
still know enough to empow you to reconstruct what i annihil
you can learn more in on year than i learnt in ten i am grate to
you and if you wish it i will show you the wai
angela listen openei ladi bellami wa right she wa greedi of
knowledg and the power that spring from knowledg
but would it not be wrong she said
there can be noth wrong in what the rule wisdom allow us to
acquir without the help of what is evil but do not be deceiv such
knowledg and power as thi is not a thing to be trifl with to
obtain a masteri over it you must devot your life to it you must
give it
allegi whole not strain to suit desir
no earthli passion must come to troubl the fix seren of your
aspir that wa on but onli on of the reason of my failur
you must leav your arthur to mr carr and henceforward put him as
much out of your mind as possibl and thi that you mai be abl to
separ yourself from earthli bond and hope and fear troubl
water reflect a broken imag
i must then choos between thi knowledg and my love
ye and you will do well if you choos the knowledg for befor
you dieif inde you do not in the end for a certain period
overcom even deathyou will be more of an angel than a woman on the
on hand then thi proud and dizzi destini await you on the other
everydai joi and sorrow share by all the world and an ordinari
attach to a man against whom i have inde noth to sai but
who is not your equal and who is at the best full of weak
that you should despis
but ladi bellami hi weak ar a part of himself and i love
him all just as he is weak need love more than what is strong
perhap but in return for your love i offer you no empti cup i do
not ask you to follow fantast theoriesof that i will soon convinc
you shall i show you the semblanc of your arthur and mr carr as
thei ar at thi moment
no ladi bellami no i have chosen you offer after year of
devot to make me almost like an angel the temptat is veri
great and it fascin me but i hope if i can succe in live a
good life to becom altogeth an angel when i die why then should
i attempt to filch fragment of a knowledg that will on dai be all
my ownif inde it is right to do so whilst i am here arthur
love is more to me than such knowledg can ever be if he is marri
i mai learn to think differ and try to sooth my mind by forc
it to run in these hidden groov till then i choos arthur and my
petti hope and fear for after all thei ar the natur heritag
of my human
ladi bellami thought for awhil and answer
i begin to think that the great power who made us ha mix even hi
most perfect work with an element of weak lest thei should soar
too high and see too far the prick of a pin will bring a balloon to
earth and an earthli passion angela will prevent you from soar
to the cloud so be it you have had your chanc it is onli on more
disappoint
chapter lxx
angela went home veri thought the next three dai she spent in
write first she wrote a clear and method account of all the
event that had happen sinc arthur first departur more than a
year ago and attach to it copi of the variou document that had
pass between herself and georg includ on of the undertak
that her husband had sign befor the marriag thi account wa in
the form of a statement which she sign and take it to mr
fraser read it to him and got him to sign it too it took her two
whole dai to write and when it wa done she label it to be
read first on the third dai she wrote the follow letter to go
with the statement
for the first time in my life arthur i take up my pen to write to
you and in truth the difficulti of the task befor me as well as my
own want of skill tend to bewild me and though i have much upon

wa deceiv into marri georg caresfoot believ you dead oh
through all etern never shall i forget that fear night nor
ceas to thank god for my merci escap from the fiend whom i had
marri and then came the morn and brought youth deadal
befor my ey and whilst i stood in the first tumult of my amaz
forget of everyth but that it wa you my own my belov
arthur no spirit but you in flesh and bloodwhilst i yet stood
thu stricken to silenc by the shock of an unutter joyyou
broke upon me with those dread word so that i choke feel how
just thei must seem to you and could not answer
and yet it sometim fill me with wonder and indign to think of
them wonder that you could believ me so mad as to throw awai the
love of my life and indign that you could deem me so lost as to
dishonour it thei drove me mad those word and from that moment
forward i rememb noth but a chao of the mind heav endlessli
like the sea but all thi ha pass and i am thank to sai that i
am quit well again now
still i should not have written to you arthur i did not even know
where you were and i never thought of recov you after what ha
pass i look upon you as altogeth lost to me for thi world but
a few dai ago i went at her own request to see ladi bellami all she
said to me i will not now repeat lest i should render thi letter too
wearisom to read though a great deal of it wa strang enough to be
well worth repetit in the upshot howev she said that i had
better write to you and told me where to write and so i write to
you dear there wa also anoth thing that she told me of sad import
for myself but which i must not shrink to face she said that there
live at madeira where you ar a ladi who is in love with you and
is herself both beauti and wealthi to whom you would have gone for
comfort in your troubl and in all probabl have marri
now arthur i do not know if thi is the case but if so i hasten
to sai that i do not blame you you smart under what must have
seem to you an intoler wrong and you went for consol to
her who had it to offer in a man that is perhap natur though it
is not a woman wai if it be so i sai from my heart be as happi as
you can but rememb what i told you long ago and do not fall into
ani delus on the matter do not imagin becaus circumst have
shape themselv thu therefor i am to be put out of your mind and
forgotten for thi is not so i cannot be forgotten though for a
while i mai be justli discard it is possibl that for thi world
you have pass out of my reach but in the next i shall claim you as
my own

fit reward for my folli but do not think that i do so without a
pang for believ me sinc my mind emerg stronger and clearer from
the storm through which it ha pass bring back to me the full
life and strength of my womanhood i have long for you with an ever
increas long i am not asham to own that i would give world

do not think me foolish dear for write to you thu i do not wish
to make you the victim of an outburst of thought that you mai think
hyster but perhap i mai never be abl to write to you again in
thi wai your wife if you ar marri mai be jealou or other
thing mai occur to prevent it i feel it therefor necessari to
tell you my inmost thought now whilst i can so that you mai alwai
rememb them dure the long come year and especi when you
draw near to the end of the journei i hope dearest arthur that
noth will ever make you forget them and also that for the sake of
the pure love you will for ever bear me you will alwai live up to
your noblest and your best for in thi wai our meet will be made
more perfect
of cours it is possibl that you mai still be free and after you
know that i am not quit so much to blame as you mai have thought
still will to give your name to me it is a bless hope but i
scarc dare to dwell upon it
the other dai i wa read a book mr fraser lent me which took my
fanci veri much it wa so full of contradict the unexpect
alwai happen in it and there wa both grief and laughter in it
page it did not end quit well or quit badli or rather it had
no end and deep down underneath the plotless stori onli peep up
now and again when the actor were troubl there ran a vein of real
sorrow and sad unchang love there wa a hero in thi odd book
which wa so like lifewho by the wai wa no hero at all but a
curiou restless creatur who seem to have miss hi mark in life
and went along look for old truth and new idea with hi ey so
fix upon the star that he wa alwai stumbl over the pebbl in
hi path and think that thei were rock he wa a sensit man
too and as weak as he wa sensit and often fell into pitfal and
did what he should not and yet for all that he had a quaint and
gentl mind and there wa someth to like in himat least so
thought the women in that book there wa a heroin too who wa all
that a heroin should be veri sweet and veri beauti and she
realli had a heart onli she would not let it beat and of cours the
hero and heroin love each other of cours too thei both behav
badli and thing went wrong or there would have been no book
but i tell you thi stori becaus onc in a rather touch scene
thi hero who made such a mess of thing set forth on of the idea
that he had found and thought new but which wa realli so veri old
he told the heroin that he had read in the star that happi ha
onli on kei and that it name is love that amidst all the
mutabl and disillus of our life the pure love of a man and
woman alon stand firm and beauti alon defi chang and
disappoint that it is the heavens salv for all our troubl
the remedi for our mistak the magic glass reflect onli what is
true and good but in the end her fact overcam hi theori and he
might have spare himself the troubl of tell and for all hi
stargaz thi hero had no real philosophi but in hi grief and
unrest pain went and threw himself into the biggest pitfal that
he could find and would have perish there had not a good angel
come and drag him out again and brush the mud off hi cloth
and take him by the hand led him along a safer path and so for
awhil he drop out of the stori which sai that when he is not
think of the lost heroin he is perhap happier than he deserv
to be
now arthur i think that thi foolish hero wa right and the
sensibl heroin he worship so blindli wrong
if you ar still unmarri and still care to put hi theori to the
test i believ that we also can make as beauti a thing of our
live as he thought that he and hi heroin could and ourselv
suprem happi in each other perfect love mai perhap be abl to
add to the happi of some of our fellowtravel that is i
think as nobl an end as a a man and woman can set befor themselv
but if on the other hand you ar ti to thi other woman who love
you by ti that cannot be broken or that honour will not let you
break or if you ar unforgiv and no longer wish to marri me as i
wish to marri you then till that bright hour of immort hope
farewel ye arthur farewel till the gate of time ha close for
ustil in the presenc of god our father i shall for ever call you
mine
ala i am so weak that my tear fall as i write the word perhap i
mai never speak or write to you again so onc more my dearest my
belov my earthli treasur and my heavenli hope farewel mai the
bless of god be as constantli around you as my thought and mai he
teach you that these ar not foolish word but rather the faint
shadow of an undi light
i send back the ring that wa us to trick me with perhap
whatev happen you will wear it for my sake it is you know a
symbol of etern

chapter lxxi
just as angela wa engag in finish her long letter to arthur
sure on of the strangest ever written by a girl to the man she
lovedmr fraser wa read an epistl which had reach him by that
afternoon post we will look over hi shoulder and see what wa in
it
it wa a letter date from the vicarag of on of the poorest parish
in the great dock district in the east of london it began
dear sir
i shall be onli too thank to entertain your propos for an
exchang of live more especi as at first sight it would
seem that all the advantag is on my side the fact is that the
incess strain of work here ha at last broken down my health to
such a degre that the doctor tell me plainli i must choos
between the compar rest of a countri parish or the certainti
of pass to a complet quiet befor my time also now that my
children ar grow up i am veri anxiou to remov them from the
sight and sound and taint moral atmospher of thi poverti
stricken and degrad quarter
but howev that mai be i should not be do my duti to you if
i did not warn you that thi is no parish for a man of your ag to
undertak unless for strong reason for i see by the clergi list
that you ar a year or so older than myself the work is
posit ceaseless and often of a most shock and thankless
charact and there ar almost no respect inhabit for
nobodi live in the parish except those who ar too poor to live
elsewher the stipend too is as you ar awar not larg
howev if in face of these disadvantag you still entertain
the idea of an exchang perhap we had better meet
the letter then enter into detail
i think that will suit me veri well said mr fraser aloud to
himself as he put it down it will not greatli matter if my health
doe break down and i ought to have gone long ago posit
ceaseless he sai the work is well ceaseless work is the onli
thing that can stifl thought and yet it will be hard come up by
the root after all these year ah me thi is a queer world and a
sad on for some of us i will write to the bishop at onc
from which it will be gather that thing had not been go well
with mr fraser
meanwhil angela put her statement and the accompani letter into a
larg envelop then she took the queer emerald ring off her finger
and as there wa nobodi look she kiss it and wrap it up in
a piec of cottonwool and stow it awai in the letter and seal
it up next she address it in her clear miniatur handwrit to
arthur p heigham esq
care of mr carr
madeira
as ladi bellami had told her and call to pigott to come with her
start off to the postoffic to regist and post her preciou
packet for the madeira mail left southampton on the morrow
she had just time to reach the offic affix the three shill
worth of stamp that the letter took and regist it when the
postman came up and she saw it stamp and bundl into hi bag with
the other just as though it were noth instead of her whole life

wild with your parabl
lord dear for all your so clever you never could see half an inch
into a brick wall and that with my mean as clear as a haystick in

a haystack be clearer in a thunderstorm than at ani other time she
look at her companion helplessli and wa silent

why dont you go to thi madmadwhat the namei never can think
of them foreign name im like jake and the flower he sai the
smaller and footier thei ar the longer the name thei stick on to
them just to puzzl a bodi who

more especi if thei ar in love with somebodi els but dear me a
sensibl woman dont bother her head about that she just goe and
hook them out of it and then she know where thei ar and keep
them there
oh pigott never mind all these reflect though im sure i dont
know how you can think of such thing the idea of compar poor dear
arthur with a tomcat but tell me how can i go to madeira suppos
that he is marri
well then you would learn all about it for yourself and no
gammon and there be an end to it on wai or the other
but would it be quit modest to run after him like that
modest inde and why shouldnt a young ladi travel for her health
i have heard sai that thi madeiri is a wonder place for the
stomach

angela felt that there wa sens in what her old nurs said though
the idea wa a new on to her and it made her thought
ill think about it she said present i wonder what mr fraser
would sai about it
perhap on thing and perhap anoth he good and kind but he
hasnt got much head for these sort of thing he alwai think of
someth els just look what a fool squir georg mai he twist and
turn in hi grave made of him you ask him if you like but you be
guid by yourself deari your head is worth six reverend fraser
when you bring it to a thing but i must be off and count the linen
that even after tea angela went down to mr fraser he wa
direct an envelop to the lord bishop of hi dioces when she
enter but he hurriedli put it awai in the blottingpap
well angela did you get your letter off
ye mr fraser it wa just in time to catch the mail tomorrow
but do you know that is what i want to speak to you about pigott
think that under all the circumstancesher angela hesit a
littlesh and i had better go to madeira and find out how thing
stand and i almost think that she is right
certainli answer mr fraser rise and look out of the
window you have a great deal at stake
you do not think that it would be immodest
my dear angela when in such a case as thi a woman goe to seek the
man she love and whom she believ love her i do not myself see
where there is room for immodesti
no nor do i and i do love him so veri dearli he is all my life to
me
mr fraser winc visibl
what is the matter have you got a headach
noth onli a twing here and he point to hi heart
angela look alarm she took a womanli interest in anybodi
ailment
i know what it is she said widow jame suffer from it you must
take it in hand at onc or it will becom chronic after meal as
her is
mr fraser smile grimli as he answer
i am afraid that i have neglect it too longit ha becom chronic
alreadi but about madeira have you then made up your mind to go
ye i think that i shall go if hei marri you knowi can
alwai come back again and perhap pigott is right the letter might
miscarri and there is so much at stake
when shall you go then
by the next steamer i suppos thei go everi week i think i will
tell my father that i am go tomorrow
ah you will want monei i suppos
no i believ that i have plenti of monei of my own now
oh ye under your marriag settlement no doubt well my dear i
am sure i hope that your journei will not be in vain did i tell you i
have also written to mr heigham by thi mail and told him all i knew
about the matter
that is veri kind and thought of you it is just like you
answer angela gentli
not at all not at all but you have never told me how you got on
with ladi bellamythat is except what she told you about mr
heigham
oh it wa a strang interview what do you think she want to teach
me
i have not the faintest idea
magic
nonsens
ye she did she told me that she could read all sort of thing in
my face and offer if i would give myself up to it to make me more
than human
pshaw it wa a bit of charlatan she want to frighten you
no i think she believ what she said and i think that she ha some
sort of power she seem disappoint when i refus and do you
know it if it had not been for arthur i do not think that i should
have refus i love power or rather knowledg but then i love
arthur more
and why is he incompat with knowledg
i do not know but she said that to triumph over the mysteri she
wish to teach me i must free myself from earthli love and care i
told her that if arthur is marri i would think of it
well angela to be frank i do not believ in ladi bellami magic
and if it practic bring peopl to what she is i think it is best
left alon inde i expect that the whole thing is a delus
aris from her condit but i think she is right when she told you
that to becom a mistress of her artor inde of ani nobl art
you must separ yourself from earthli passion i ow your arthur a
grudg as well as ladi bellami i hope angela to see you rise like
a star upon thi ag of insol and infidel i want you to be a
great woman but that dream is all over now
why mr fraser
becaus my dear both histori and observ teach us that great
gift like your partak of the charact of an accid in a woman
thei ar not natur to her and she doe not wear such jewel easili
thei put her outsid of her sex it is someth as though a man
were born into the world with wing at first he would be veri proud
of them and go sail about in the sky to the admir of the
crowd beneath him but byandbi he would grow tire of fly alon
and after all it is not necessari to fly to transact the ordinari
busi of the world and perhap at last he would learn to love
somebodi without wing somebodi who could not fly and he would
alwai want to be with her down on the home earth and not alon up
in the heavenli height if a woman had all the geniu of plato or all
the learn of solomon it would be forgotten at the touch of a
babi finger
well well we cannot fight against human natur and i daresai that
in a few year you will forget that you can read greek as well as you
can english and were veri near find out a perfect wai of squar
the circl perhap it is best so ladi bellami mai have read a great
mani fine thing in your face shall i tell you what i read there i
read that you will marri your arthur and becom a happi wife and a
happier mother that your life will be on long stori of unassum
kind and that when at last you die you will becom a sacr
memori in mani heart that is what i read the onli magic you will
ever wield angela will be the magic of your good
who know we cannot read the futur she answer
and so you ar go to madeira next week then thi will be the
last time that we shall meetbefor you go i meanfor i am off to
london tomorrow for a while on some busi when next we meet if
we do meet again angela you will be a marri woman do not start
dear there is noth shock about that but perhap we shall not
meet ani more
oh mr fraser why do you sai such dread thing
there is noth dread about it angela i am get on in life
and am not so strong as i wa and you ar both young and strong and
must in the ordinari cours of thing outliv me for mani year but
whatev happen my dear i know that you alwai keep a warm corner
in your memori for your old master and as for me i can honestli
sai that to have known and taught you ha been the greatest privileg
of a rather lone life
here angela began to cry
dont cry my dear there is thank god anoth meetingplac than
thi and if i reach the shore of that great futur befor you i
shallbut there my dear it is time for you to be go home you
must not stop here to listen to thi melancholi talk go home angela
and think about your lover i am busi tonight give me a kiss dear
and go
present she wa gone and he heard the frontdoor close behind her
he went to the window and watch the tall form gradual grow
fainter in the gloam till it vanish altogeth
then he came back and sit down at hi writingt rest hi
grizzl head upon hi hand and thought present he rais it and
there wa a sad smile flicker round the wrinkl of the nervou
mouth
and now for hard labour at the london dock he said aloud
chapter lxxii
noth occur to mar the prosper of the voyag of the even
star that beauti littl vessel declin to simplifi the cours of
thi histori by go to the bottom with mildr and arthur as the
imagin reader mai have perhap expect she did not even get
into a terrif storm in order to give arthur the opportun of
perform heroic feat and the writer of thi histori the chanc of
displai a profound knowledg of the name of rope and spar on
the contrari she glide on upon a sea so still that even miss terri
wa persuad to arous herself from her torpor and come upon deck
till at last on morn the giant peak of teneriff soar high
abov it circl cloud broke upon the view of her passeng
here thei stop for a week or so enjoi themselv veri much in
their new surround till at length arthur grew tire of the
island which wa of cours the signal for their departur so thei
return reach madeira after an absenc of close upon a month as
thei drop anchor in the littl bai mildr came up to arthur and
touch him with that gentl defer which she alwai show
toward him ask him if he wa not glad to be home again
home he said i have no home
oh arthur she answer why do you try to pain me is not my home
your also
so soon as thei land he start off to mile hotel to see if
ani letter had come for him dure hi absenc and return look
veri much put out
what is the matter arthur ask miss terri onc again happi at
feel her feet upon solid soil
why those idiot at the hotel have return a letter sent to me by
my lawyer thei thought that i had left madeira for good and the
letter wa mark if left return to messr borlei and son with
the address and the mail went out thi afternoon into the bargain so
it will be a month befor i can get it back again
had arthur known that thi letter contain clip of the newspap
report of the inquest on georg caresfoot of whose death even he wa
in total ignor he would have had good reason to be put out
never mind arthur said mildr clear voic at hi elbowsh wa
rare much further from him than hi shadow lawyer letter ar
not as a rule veri interest i never yet had on that would not
keep come and see if your pavilionisnt that a grand namei
arrang to your like and then let us go to dinner for agatha here
is dy of hungersh ha to make up for her abstin at sea
i wa alwai told broke in that ladi that yacht wa charm
but i tell you frankli i have never been more miser in my life
than i wa on board your even star
never mind dear you shall have a nice long rest befor we start for
the coast of spain
and so arthur soon settl down again into the easi tenor of madeira
life he now scarc made a pretenc of live at the hotel sinc
dure their cruis mildr had had a pavilion which stood in the
garden luxuri set up for hi occup here he wa happi enough
in a dull numb wai and as the dai went on someth of the old
light came back to hi ey and hi footfal again grew quick and
strong as when it us to fall in the corridor of the abbei hous of
the past he never spoke nor did mildr ever allud to angela after
that convers at sea which had end so strang she content
herself with attempt to supplant her and to a certain extent she
wa success no man could have for veri long remain obdur to
such beauti and such patient devot and it is not wonder that he
grew in a wai to love her
but there wa thi peculiar about the affairnam that the
affect which he bore her wa born more of her stronger will than of
hi own feel as wa shown by the fact that so long as he wa
actual with her and within the circl of her influenc her power
over him wa predomin but the moment that he wa out of her
sight hi thought would fall back into their origin channel and
the old sore would begin to run howev much too he might be
success in get the masteri of thi troubl by dai at night
thei would assert themselv and from the constant and torment
dream which thei inspir he could find no mean of escap
for at least four night out of everi seven from the moment that he
close hi ey till he open them again the morn it would seem
to him that he had been in the compani of angela under everi possibl
varieti of circumst talk to her walk with her meet her
suddenli or unexpectedli in crowd place or at dinnerparti
alwai her and no on elsetil at last poor arthur began to wonder
if hi spirit took leav of hi bodi in sleep and went to seek her
and what is more found her or wa it noth but a fantasi he
could not tell but at ani rate it wa a fact and it would have
been hard to sai if it distress or rejoic him most
occasion too he would fall into a fit of brood melancholi
that would last him for a dai or two and which mildr would find it
quit imposs to dispel inde when he got in that wai she soon
discov that the onli thing to do wa to leav him alon he wa
suffer acut there wa no doubt about that and when ani anim
suffer includ man it is best left in solitud a sick or wound
beast alwai turn out of the herd to recov or die
when mildr saw him in thi state of mental desol she would
shake her head and sigh for it told her that she wa as far as ever
from the golden gate of her eldorado as ha been said her wa the
strongest will and even if he had not will it she could have
marri him ani dai she wish but odd as it mai seem she wa too
conscienti she had determin that she would not marri him unless
she wa certain that he love her and to thi resolut as yet she
firmli held whatev her fault mai have been mildr carr had all
the nobl unselfish that is so common in her sex for herself and
her own reput she care compar speak noth whilst
for arthur ultim happi she wa veri solicit
on eveningit wa on of arthur black dai when he had got a fit
of what mildr call angela feverthei were walk togeth in
the garden arthur in silenc with hi hand in hi pocket and hi
pipe in hi mouth and mildr hum a littl tune by wai of amus
herself when thei came to the wall that edg the precipic arthur
leant over it and gaze at the depth below
dont dear you will tumbl over said mildr in some alarm
i think it would be a good thing if i did he answer moodili
ar you then so tire of the worldand me
no dear i am not tire of you forgiv me mildr but i am
dreadfulli miser i know that it is veri ungraci and ungrat
of me but it is the fact
you ar think of her again arthur
ye i have got a fit of it i suppos that she ha not been out of
my mind for an hour altogeth dure the last fortyeight hour talk
of be haunt by a dead person it is infinit wors be
haunt by a live on
i am veri sorri for you dear
do you suppos mildr that thi will go on for all my life that i
shall alwai be at the merci of these bitter memori and thought
i dont know arthur i hope not
i wish i were deadi wish i were dead he broke out passion
she ha destroi my life all that wa happi in me is dead onli my
bodi live on i am sure i dont know mildr how you can care for
anyth so worthless
she kiss him and answer
dearest i had rather love you as you ar than ani other man aliv
time doe wonder perhap in time you will get over it oh arthur
when i think of what she ha made you and what you might have been if
you had never known her i long to tell that woman all my mind but
you must be a man dear it is weak to give wai to a mad passion such
as thi is now try to think of someth els work at someth
i have no heart for it mildr i dont feel as though i could work
and if you cannot make me forget i am sure i do not know what will
mildr sigh and did not answer though she spoke hopefulli about
it to him she had littl faith in hi get over hi passion for
angela now either she must marri him as he wa or els let him go
altogeth but which the struggl between her affect and her idea
of duti wa veri sore and as yet she could come to no conclus
on thing there wa that troubl her consider and thi wa that
though madeira wa almost empti there were enough peopl in it to get
up a good deal of gossip about herself and arthur now it would have
been difficult to find anybodi more entir careless of the judgment
of societi than mildr more especi as her great wealth and
gener popular protect her from slight but for all her
odditi she wa a thorough woman of the world and she knew none
better that in pursuanc of an almost invari natur law there
is noth that lower a woman so much in the estim of a man as
the knowledg that she is talk about even though he himself is the
caus of the talk thi mai be both illog and unjust but it is
none the less true
but if mildr still hesit arthur did not he wa veri anxiou
that thei should be marri inde he almost insist on it the
posit wa on that wa far from be agreeabl to him for all
such intimaci must from their veri natur necessit a certain
amount of fals swear thei ar throughout an act lie and when
the lie is act it must sometim be spoken now thi is a state of
affair that is repugn to an honour man and on that not
unfrequ becom perfectli intoler mani is the loveaffair
that come to a sudden end becaus the man find it imposs to
perman constitut himself a peregrin falsehood but oddli
enough it ha been found difficult to persuad the other contract
parti of the valid of the excus and howev unjust it mai be
on ha known of men who have seen their defect energet set
down to more vulgar caus
arthur wa no except to thi rule he found himself in a fals
posit and he hate it inde he determin befor long he would
place it befor mildr in the light of an altern that he should
either marri her or that an end should be put to their exist
relat

revers full speed whilst hi mind itself with quick shudder and
confus still forg ahead upon it former cours he rose and
cast upon the scene around him that long look we give to the place
where a great happi ha found us
the sun wa sink fast behind the mountain turn their slab
side and soar pinnacl to giant shield and spear of fire
beneath their mass shadowsforerunn of the nightcrept over the
forest and the crest roller whilst further from him the ocean
heav in a rosi glow abov the everchang vault of heaven wa of
a beauti that no brush could paint on a groundwork of burn red
were pile height upon height deep ridg of purpl and of
crimson nearer the horizon the colour brighten to a dazzl
gold till at length thei narrow to the white intens of the half
hidden ey of the sun vanish behind the mountain whilst
underli the steadi splendour of the upper ski flush soft and
melt shade of rose and lilac blue space abov him wa broken up
by fantast cloud that float all on fire and glow like molten
metal the reflect too of all these mass and vari light in
the azur of the eastern ski wa full of sharp contrast and soft
surpris and a travel eagl sail through space befor them
seem to gather all their tint upon hi vivid wing and as he
pass awai to leav a rainbow track of broken light
but such a glori wa too bright to last the sun sank swiftli the
celesti fire pale the purpl grew faint and di and where
thei had been night trail her sombr plume across the sea and sky
but still the quiet glow of even linger and present a line of
light wa shot athwart it cut a track of glori across the
shadow sea so weird and sudden that it might well have been the
first rai of a resurrect morn break in upon the twilight of the
dead
he gaze almost in aw till the majest sight still the tumult of
hi heart and hi thought went up in thank to the creator for the
pure love he had found again and which had not betrai him then he

the shadow her face illumin by that soft yet vivid light her
trembl arm outstretch to clasp himwa hi lost angela
he saw her question glanc fall upon him and the red blood waver
on her cheek he saw the lovelight gather in her ey and then he
saw no more for she wa in hi arm murmur sweet broken word
happi ar those who thu shall find their angela whether it be here
oron the further shore of yonder solemn sea
and mildr she lai there befor the stone symbol of inexor
judgment and sob till the dark cover her and her heart
broke in the silenc
