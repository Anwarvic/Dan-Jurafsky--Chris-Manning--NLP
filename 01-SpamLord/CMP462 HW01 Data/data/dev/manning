<p>
Chris Manning works on systems and formalisms that can intelligently
process and produce human languages.  His research concentrates on
probabilistic models of language and statistical natural language
processing; including text understanding, text mining,
machine translation, information extraction, named entity recognition,
part-of-speech tagging, probabilistic parsing and semantic role
labeling, syntactic typology, computational lexicography, and other
topics in computational linguistics and machine learning.

<h2>Books</h2>

<p>
My new book, an 
<a href="http://informationretrieval.org/">Introduction
to Information Retrieval</a>, with Hinrich Sch&uuml;tze and Prabhakar
Raghavan, is now available in print.  My "bestseller" is Manning and
Sch&uuml;tze, <A HREF="/fsnlp/promo/">Foundations
of Statistical Natural Language Processing</a> (MIT Press, 1999).
My two monographs are
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1575860368/">Ergativity:
Argument Structure and Grammatical Relations</a> and 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/157586164X/">Complex
Predicates and Information Spreading in LFG</a>.
</p>

<h2>Talks</h2>

<p>
A few <a href="talks/">talks</a> are available online.
</p>

<h2>Research Projects</h2>

<p>
My current research focuses on robust but linguistically sophisticated
probabilistic natural language processing, and opportunities to use it
in real-world domains.  Particularly topics include richer models for
probabilistic parsing, computational semantics, machine translation,
grammar induction, text categorization and clustering, 
incorporating probabilistic models into syntactic
theories, electronic dictionaries and their
usability, particularly for indigenous languages, information extraction
and presentation, and linguistic typology.  
</p>

<p>My research at Stanford is currently supported by an IBM Faculty
Partnership Award, IARPA, DARPA, and the NSF.
<!--
Previous funding at Stanford comes from IARPA/DTO
 a Terman Fellowship, <a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0085896">NSF</a>
(for <a href="http://i.stanford.edu/gib/">GIB</a>), NTT, NHK, and the
Australian Reseach Council.  -->

<p>
I am interested in new students wanting to work in the area of 
Natural Language Processing.  To find out more about what I do, it's
best to look at my <a href="papers/">papers</a>, or my <a
href="/research.shtml">group research page</a>.  However, to cut down on
my email load, it's necessary to put in some more information:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Unadmitted students: The above statement is directed at students who have
already been admitted to Stanford.
I don't do admissions. You need to apply to a program in the usual
manner; for Linguistics see 
<a href="http://www-linguistics.stanford.edu/graduate/admissions.shtml">http://www-linguistics.stanford.edu/graduate/admissions.shtml</a>,
and for Computer Science, see 
<a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/Admissions/">http://cs.stanford.edu/Admissions/</a>.
</li> 
<li>PhD students in CS/Linguistics or allied fields: please contact me
directly.</li>
<li>Masters students: I have normally employed a couple of masters
	  students.  Most appealing are people with a background in NLP,
	  and time to devote to an RAship.
If you want to convince me, your
best approach is to do well in <a href="http://cs224n.stanford.edu">CS 224N: 
NLP</a>.</li>
<li>Undergraduate students in CS/Linguistics or allied fields: please
contact me directly.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Courses</h2>

<p>
In fall 2008, I will again teach 
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs276/">CS 276</a>: Information
Retrieval and Web Search</a>, with 
<a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/people/raghavan/">Prabhakar Raghavan</a>
Earlier versions of this course include two years of two-quarter sequences
CS276A/B on information retrieval and text information classification
and extraction, broadly construed ("IR++"):
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs276a/">Fall
quarter course website</a>.
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs276b/">Winter
quarter course website</a>.
This course started in 2001.  Early versions were also co-taught by
<a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~schuetze/">Hinrich Sch&uuml;tze</a>.
</p>

<p>
In spring 2009, I will again teach
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/">CS 224N / Ling 237. Natural
	Language Processing</a> --
Develops an in-depth understanding of
both the algorithms available for the processing of linguistic information
and the underlying computational properties of natural languages.
Morphological, syntactic, and semantic processing from both a linguistic
and an algorithmic perspective.  Focus on modern quantitative techniques
in
NLP: using large corpora, statistical models for acquisition,
disambiguation, and parsing.  Examination and construction of
representative systems.  Prerequisites: 121/221 or Ling 138/238, and
programming experience.  Recommended: basic familiarity with logic and
probability.  3 units. 
I've taught this course yearly since Spr 2000.
Many <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/">previous
student projects</a> are available online.
</p>

<p>
In fall 2007 I taught
<a href="courses/ling289/ling289-2007-syllabus.htm">Ling 289:
Quantitative and Probabilistic Explanation in Linguistics</a>
MW 2:15-3:45 in 160-318.
I previously taught it in winter 2002 
(n&eacute;e <a href="courses/ling236/">Ling 236</a>) and
Winter 2005 (as <a href="http://linguist235.stanford.edu/">Ling 235</a>).
</p>

<p>In the summer of 2007, I taught at the LSA Linguistic Institute:
<a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/lsa354/">Statistical
Parsing</a> and 
<a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/lsa306/">Computational
Linguistics in Industry</a>.</p>

<p>
In fall 1999 and winter 2001, I taught
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs121/">CS 121 Artificial 
Intelligence</a>.  The text book was S. Russell and P. Norvig,
<a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/">Artificial
Intelligence: A Modern Approach</a>.
</p>

<p>
The NLP Reading Group (which I ran 1999-2002) has now been transformed
into <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/events.shtml">The Natural
	Language and Speech Processing Colloquium</a>.
</p>

<h2>Other stuff</h2>

<p>
With mobile email, I desperately needed spam filtering happening
on the mail server.  Here are <a
href="mobile/IMAPfiltering.html">instructions</a> on how to set that up
at Stanford.  For using the web, here are some 
some <a href="mobile/">sites for PDA browsing</a>.</p>

<p>
LaTeX: When I used to have more time (i.e., when I was a grad student), I used
to spend some of it writing <a href="tex/">(La)TeX macros</a>.
[Actually, that's a lie; I still spend some time doing it....]
