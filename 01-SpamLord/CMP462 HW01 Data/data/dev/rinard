<H3> Biographical Sketch</H3>

<P>
I received the Sc.B. in Computer Science, Magna cum Laude
and with Honors, from Brown University in 1984. I spent the next several
years working for two startup companies, Ikan Systems and Polygen Corporation.
I then entered the Ph.D. program in Computer Science at Stanford University,
and received the Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University in
1994. I joined the Computer Science Department at the University of California,
Santa Barbara as an Assistant Professor in 1994, then moved to MIT as an
Assistant Professor in 1997. I was promoted to Associate Professor in 2000.
