<h3>Biographical sketch</h3>

Marc Levoy is a Professor of Computer Science and (jointly) Electrical
Engineering at Stanford University.  He received a Bachelor's and Master's in
Architecture from Cornell University in 1976 and 1978, and a PhD in Computer
Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1989.  In the
1970's Levoy worked on computer animation, developing an early
computer-assisted cartoon animation system.  This system was used by
Hanna-Barbera Productions from 1983 until 1996 to produce The Flintstones,
Scooby Doo, and other shows.  In the 1980's Levoy worked on volume rendering, a
family of techniques for displaying sampled three-dimensional functions, for
example computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) data.  In the
1990's he worked on technology and algorithms for digitizing three-dimensional
objects.  This led to the Digital Michelangelo Project, in which he and a team
of researchers spent a year in Italy digitizing the statues of Michelangelo
using laser scanners.  His current interests include light field sensing and
display, computational photography, and applications of computer graphics in
microscopy and biology.  Awards: Charles Goodwin Sands Medal for best
undergraduate thesis (1976), National Science Foundation Presidential Young
Investigator (1991), ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics Achievement Award (1996),
ACM Fellow (2007).  Recent professional service: Papers Chair of SIGGRAPH 2007.

<h3>Personal stuff:</h3>
<ul>
<li>	Louis Fabian Bachrach's nice 1997
	photographs of me (<a href=Marc_Museum2_35-light.gif>here</a> and
	<a href=Marc_Museum1-light-cs.jpg>here</a>)
	for the Computer Museum in Boston (now closed),
<li>	I do occasionally wear something besides blue dress shirts.
	Here are shots with other shirts, from
	<a href=marc-sanjacinto-aug01-scesh.jpg>August 2001</a> and
	<a href=marc-levoy-siggraph03-eew400.jpg>July 2003</a>.
<li>	Yes, that's a <a href=http://www.deathride.com/>Death Ride</a>
	T-shirt	in the third shot.  I also rode in 2005,
<!--
	<a href=images/deathride03-carson-balssh.jpg>2003</a>
-->
	and yes, I finished all 5 passes - 15,000 feet of climbing.
	That's why I'm smiling in this official ride
	<a href=images/deathride05-carson-ssh.jpg>photograph</a>,
	taken at the top of Carson Pass after 12 hours of cycling.
<li>	Some <a href="/group_photos.html">
	group photos</a> with colleagues and students
<li>	A small collection of
	<a href=http://picasaweb.google.com/marclevoy>
	digital and computational photographs</a> I've taken.
<li>	Photographic essays about personal aspects of my 1998-99
	<a href="/projects/mich/mich.html#private collection">
	sabbatical in Italy</a>
<li>	During my year abroad, I
	<a href=/projects/mich/learning-to-carve>
	learned to carve</a>
	in marble.
<li>	Sculptures by
	<a href="chesler/chesler.html">my mother</a>,
	who unlike me has real talent.
<li>	I've been measuring and rendering 3D objects for a long time.<br>
	Here are some drawings I made in college for the
	<a href=habs-drawings>Historic American Buildings Survey</a>.
<li>	I still like finding and measuring old objects,
	especially if it involves getting dirty.<br>
	This photographic essay describes a week I spent on an
	<a href=/projects/forma-urbis/dig-in-rome/>archaeological dig
	in the Roman Forum</a>.
<li>	My favorite interview, by Noah Adams of
	National Public Radio's
	All Things Considered, June 13, 2000.<br>
	(Click to hear the interview using RealAudio at
	<a href="http://www.npr.org/
	ramfiles/atc/20000613.atc.09.ram">14.4Kbs</a> or

	This
	<!--<a href=siggraph-2003-interview.htm>-->
	<a href=http://www.siggraph.org/conferences/REPORTS/s2003/interviews/levoy.html>interview</a>
	at SIGGRAPH 2003, by Wendy Ju, runs a close second.
<li>	I also liked the cover of the
	<a href=images/sig01-cover-h800.jpg>Siggraph 2001 proceedings</a>.
	The image is from a paper (in the proceedings) on
	<a href=/papers/bssrdf>subsurface scattering</a>,
	co-authored with Henrik Wann Jensen, Steve Marschner, and Pat Hanrahan.
	And check out this <a href=images/three-milks-sssh.jpg>milk</a>.
	Or this <a href=images/three-milks-ssh.jpg>large version</a>.
	This paper won an Academy Award in 2004.
<li>	However, not everything went smoothly at Siggraph 2001.
	A more-strenuous-than-expected after-Siggraph hike
	inspired Pat Hanrahan's and my students to create this humorous
	<a href=/public_photos/san_jacinto_2001/movie_poster.jpg>
	movie poster</a>.
	Click here for the
	<a href=/group_photos.html#sanjacinto01>innocent version</a>
	of this story.  And here for the
	<a href=/public_photos/san_jacinto_2001/>real story</a>.
<li>	A lot of my research relates to volume data.
	The cause may be genetic.  My mother's cousin, <!-- <a
	href=http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/people_chesler.htm> --> David
	Chesler is credited with the first demonstration of <em>filtered
	backprojection</em>, the dominant method used in computed tomography
	(CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) for combining multiple
	projections to yield 3D medical data.  Here is a <a
	href=http://www.mit.edu/~glb/node4.html>description</a> of his
	contributions.<br>
<li>	My father's genes also seem to be guiding my research tastes.
	Optics has been in my family for four generations.  My father Barton
	Monroe Levoy and my grandfather Monroe Benjamin Levoy were opticians
	and sellers of eyeglasses (<a href=history-of-tura-2006.jpeg>Tura</a>).
	My great-grandfather Benjamin Monroe Levoy sold cameras, microscopes,
	and other optical instruments in New York City a century ago.  Here is
	a piece of <a href=images/bmlevoy-stationary-ssh.jpg>stationary</a>
	from his store.  This specimen of a <a
	href=images/mandible-noarray-cssh.jpg>silkworm mouth</a>, believed to
	be from one of his microscope slide collections, appears in our
	SIGGRAPH 2006 paper on <a
	href=http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/lfmicroscope/>light field
	microscopy</a>.
