<h2>Name Pronunciation</h2>
<p>
In case you are wondering how to pronounce my last name, it's
<b>OH-stir-howt</b>.  This may make more sense if you know that
the original Dutch version of the name was Oosterhout (many
generations ago).
</p>
<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>
My research is in the area of Web application development.
The research has two overall goals:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the creation of highly
interactive Web applications, as opposed to the tables-and-forms
approach used by most Web applications today.</li>
<li>Develop high-level reusable components that simplify the creation
of interactive Web applications, and frameworks that encourage the
development of new components.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The primary vehicle for this research is Fiz, a new Web application
development framework that will be released in open-source form.  In
the future the research may spread into adjacent areas, including
Web-scale storage systems and programming languages.
</p>
<h2>Short Biography</h2>
<p>
John K. Ousterhout is Professor (Research) of Computer Science
at Stanford University.  He is also Chairman of
<a HREF="http://www.electric-cloud.com">Electric Cloud, Inc.</a>
He is probably best known as the creator of the Tcl scripting
language and is also well known for his work in distributed
operating systems, high-performance file systems, and user
interfaces.  Ousterhout
received a BS degree in Physics from Yale University in 1975 and
a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1980.
He was Professor of Computer Science at U.C. Berkeley from
1980-1994, Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems from
1994-1998, founder and CEO of Scriptics Corporation from
1988-2000, and founder/CEO/Chairman of Electric Cloud from
2002-2007.  Ousterhout is a member of the National Academy of
Engineering and a Fellow of the ACM. He has received 
numerous awards, including the ACM Software System Award,
the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award, the National Science
Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award, and the
U.C. Berkeley Distinguished Teaching Award.

    <a href="scripting.html">Scripting: Higher Level Programming for
    the 21st Century</a>.  This white paper discusses the difference
    between scripting (in languages such as Tcl) and system programming
    (in languages such as C and Java). It shows why scripting languages
    are fundamentally better than system programming languages 
    for gluing tasks such as GUIs and enterprise applications, and
    why the  importance of scripting has increased in recent years and
    will continue to  increase in the future. The paper was published
    in the March, 1998 issue of <i>IEEE Computer</i>.

<li>
    <i>Why Threads Are A Bad Idea (for most purposes)</i>. This was
    an Invited Talk  at the 1996 USENIX Technical Conference (January 25,
    1996). The talk compares the threads style of programming to an
    alternative approach, events, that use only a single thread of
    control. Although each approach has its weaknesses, 
    events result in simpler, more manageable code than threads,
    with efficiency that is generally as good as or better than threads.
    Many of the applications 
    for which threading has been recommended (including nearly all 
    user-interface applications) would be better off with an event-based 
    implementation. The slides for the talk are available in
    <a href="threads.ppt">PowerPoint</a> or <a href="threads.pdf">PDF</a>
    format. There isn't a written paper that corresponds to this talk.
