<P> I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department.  

<P>Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a programmer at
Taligent (now part of <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</A>).  At Taligent, I 
worked on
Places for Project Teams, a groupware product designed to improve 
communication and coordination within small project teams.  I was
fortunate to work with the Places for Project Teams product throughout an
entire software lifecycle&#151from initial product conception through 
the actual product launch.

<P> I have a Ph.D. from the <A HREF="http://www.uci.edu/">
University of California, Irvine</A>, where I specialized in Software 
Engineering.  My dissertation was on process support for software
engineering teams.  I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a
specialization in Artificial Intelligence, and bachelors degrees
in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.

<P> At Irvine, I taught <I> Introduction to Software Engineering</I>,
a sophomore core class, and <I> Software Processes</I>, a graduate seminar.
I also worked as a peer academic advisor, a freshmen orientation advisor,
and served on leadership for campus chapters of both 
<A HREF="http://www.habitat.org/">Habitat for Humanity</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.intervarsity.org/">InterVarsity Christian Fellowship</A>.

<P> At Stanford, I teach <I> CS105: Introduction to Computer Science for
Non-Technical Students</I> and <I> CS193W: Microsoft Windows Programming</I>.
I will also be teaching the <I> CS194: Senior Project</I> class this year.

<P>  
In my spare time, I participate in a variety of activities including:
