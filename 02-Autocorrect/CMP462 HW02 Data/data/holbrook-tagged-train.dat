you have <ERR targ=make> mack </ERR> <ERR targ=sure> shore </ERR> they have <ERR targ=dry> drye </ERR> straw
when you clean them out you should not leave a <ERR targ=fork> falk </ERR> in with them because the mother might <ERR targ=knock> nock </ERR> it down and the little pigs might stab <ERR targ=themselves> them souve </ERR>
we give <ERR targ=them> the </ERR> <ERR targ=worm> worme </ERR> <ERR targ=powder> pouder </ERR>
that is when they get the <ERR targ=worm> worme </ERR>

 One Saturday I <ERR targ=thought> though </ERR> I would go to the Races at London
I went on my <ERR targ=Royal> Royl </ERR> Enfield

there were the new <ERR targ=Japanese> Japannese </ERR> <ERR targ=Honda> Hondor </ERR>
they are very <ERR targ=fast> farst </ERR> and <ERR targ=getting> geting </ERR> quite popular in England
I saw one man come off

<ERR targ=another> a nouther </ERR> man <ERR targ=hurt> hearte </ERR> <ERR targ=his> is </ERR> arm in a sidecar race
I <ERR targ=don't> dont </ERR> <ERR targ=think> thing </ERR> it was much
I <ERR targ=saw> sow </ERR> a <ERR targ=sidecar> side car </ERR> <ERR targ=turn> turne </ERR> right over
the <ERR targ=sidecar> side care </ERR> man was alright but the <ERR targ=motorbike> motor bike </ERR> Rider was thrown into the crowd
I <ERR targ=don't> dont </ERR> <ERR targ=know> no </ERR> what <ERR targ=happened> hapend </ERR> to him
he was <ERR targ=hurt> heart </ERR> quite bad.
the sidecar broke off the <ERR targ=motorbike> moter bike </ERR> and <ERR targ=spun> spund </ERR> down the track for 7 yards then hit a man who was on the corner and killed him
his hat was blowing down the track
the <ERR targ=motorbike> moter bike </ERR> <ERR targ=caught> caugh </ERR> fire and <ERR targ=blew> blow </ERR> up
the <ERR targ=petrol> petal </ERR> went all over the track but they <ERR targ=soon> sone </ERR> put it out by sand

<ERR targ=he's> his </ERR> <ERR targ=won> one </ERR> by 3 yards and a <ERR targ=Royal> Royl </ERR> Enfield 2 and a <ERR targ=Honda> Hondor </ERR> 3.
The End 

we went over the football field it was quite wet and soon made my toes cold.
the grass was quite long now it <ERR targ=shone> shon </ERR> with the dew on it.
a field <ERR targ=ploughed> ploud </ERR> next to it I think it was <ERR targ=done> don </ERR> yesterday.
on the other side was <ERR targ=a> an </ERR> hedge
it had a lot of thorns in it .
they <ERR targ=had> hade </ERR> <ERR targ=cleaned> cleand </ERR> the river and made it very wide <ERR targ=for> fore </ERR> the ducks
there were some <ERR targ=potatoes> potato </ERR> in the water .
there were some brussels men sitting in the <ERR targ=pathway> parth way </ERR> round a fire
we had to go on to a <ERR targ=ploughed> ploud </ERR> field to get round them this made my shoes <ERR targ=heavy> hevey </ERR> .
this was quite muddy
some boys did not think much to it nor did I but we still went.
the dew on the brussels leaves made them <ERR targ=like> look </ERR> <ERR targ=pearls> pirls </ERR> .
Mr. Holbrook went over the brook first
some were boys going round but only one went
after all the rest went over the tree Gerald <ERR targ=nearly> nealy </ERR> went in
one foot <ERR targ=touched> toch </ERR> the water
then we went across the new <ERR targ=piece> pice </ERR> of grass into school
we went and <ERR targ=cleaned> cleand </ERR> our shoes with paper
then the bell went for <ERR targ=break> brack </ERR> .

He was <ERR targ=too> to </ERR> young to to understand he was crying all the time <ERR targ=nevertheless> never the less </ERR> .

 It happened to me When I was 4 years old I very nearly <ERR targ=died> diad </ERR> .
It was one sunday when my 3 older sisters and I were out for a walk I had my photo taken near a brook.
I still have the photo.
The brook was about 8 feet wide.
The water was about 2 feet deep.
But <ERR targ=there> they </ERR> was 6 feet <ERR targ=of> off </ERR> wet slimy mud I was the first to cross the bridge it broke and in I went.
I <ERR targ=slowly> slolly </ERR> sank in the mud my 2 youngest sisters ran home but my oldest sister <ERR targ=stopped> stoped </ERR> and saved my life she held my head above water <ERR targ=until> untill </ERR> my sisters got home and told my parents.
then they raced down to the brook dad <ERR targ=had> have </ERR> a hell of a Job pulling me out as the mud held me down eventually <ERR targ=he> his </ERR> got me out and <ERR targ=carried> carred </ERR> me home.
my clothes had to <ERR targ=be> me </ERR> <ERR targ=destroyed> distrod </ERR> it took seven <ERR targ=baths> bath </ERR> to get me <ERR targ=clean> clearn </ERR> .

 <ERR targ=I'm> Im </ERR> am never <ERR targ=allowed> alloud </ERR> to sit up and watch <ERR targ=programmes> programes </ERR> not <ERR targ=suitable> surtebull </ERR> for children one night when dad was digging the garden mum had gone out, <ERR targ=there> they </ERR> was a film on TV <ERR targ=unfit> unfitt </ERR> for children I sat and watched it, it was all murder and killing, men were being hung and <ERR targ=others> other </ERR> were being shot or <ERR targ=stabbed> stabed </ERR> .
men had their heads cut in half .

 My work on a farm I have live on a farm all <ERR targ=of> off </ERR> my life, I am not <ERR targ=boasting> bosting </ERR> but I think I know a fair bit about farming.
I know most about cattle and only a little about machinery.
Some people say farming is the lowest <ERR targ=paid> payed </ERR> and hardest working <ERR targ=employment> imployment </ERR> out.
I agree with those people.
but I would rather work for my living, than just <ERR targ=sitting> siting </ERR> in a <ERR targ=stuffy> stufy </ERR> old office adding up numbers all day or whatever they do.
Give me the open air life.
My father is a farm stockman and I hope to take on the same Job when I leave school.
I am going to take my <ERR targ=apprenticeship> apprentiship </ERR> course when I leave at easter.
that means that I go to <ERR targ=classes> classis </ERR> <ERR targ=once> ones </ERR> a week.
I will learn a lot more about farming and if I pull through the course I will be a <ERR targ=useful> usfull </ERR> chap about the farm.
<ERR targ=While> Will </ERR> I am taking my course I will be <ERR targ=getting> get </ERR> 17 <ERR targ=shillings> shilling </ERR> less than the boy worker that is not taking the course.
But when I am 17 and finished my <ERR targ=Apprenticeship> Apprentiship </ERR> I will get 10% more than the average pay <ERR targ=of> off </ERR> a boy my age.
Many people asked me why I have <ERR targ=chosen> choosen </ERR> farming as my future <ERR targ=career> carrer </ERR> .
(1) I will be in the open air.
(2) I will be doing a <ERR targ=different> diffrent </ERR> Job every day (3) I am not interested in <ERR targ=anything> enthing </ERR> else.
For the last 2 or 3 years I am have been <ERR targ=working> work </ERR> on the farm in the holidays.
And I can tell the men I have worked with have been good and <ERR targ=given> give </ERR> me a few tips.
my dad has told quite a lot about farming which I know will help when I <ERR targ=leave> life </ERR> school.
So if anybody <ERR targ=wants> want </ERR> an open air life, choose FARMING

 When a woman looks in her Pram
One day a young woman went down the street to do her shopping.
She went into the shop to order her weekly meat, of course she left her baby <ERR targ=outside> out side </ERR> the shop.
Her baby was still sitting her its pram, but the little baby was crying.
the little baby could not talk much he could say little words.
<ERR targ=His> He's </ERR> Mum said to him "Now what are you crying for My little baby, "he keep on "Man, Man,", he <ERR targ=meant> mean't </ERR> that Man which were going down the road, at first she could not understand him you see this man had a black baby in a blue pram And a woman came over the road <ERR targ=and> a </ERR> said "you better watch <ERR targ=where> were </ERR> you leave <ERR targ=your> you </ERR> baby misses." the baby's <ERR targ=mother> mothers </ERR> said "why" so the other lady" said, "because you know that old man which <ERR targ=has> as </ERR> Just gone down the road, well he tried to take your little baby out of <ERR targ=its> it's </ERR> pram.
So she said "thank you very much for telling me, and said "goodbye So the lady <ERR targ=walked> walk </ERR> on with her baby.
This time she went into the baker's to get some bread.
The old man with the baby was outside the fishmonger, which was just aside the  baker's.
The Lady went in, and while she was in the man changed <ERR targ=babies> babys </ERR> .
So he had the white one and she had the black one, of course he ran away, no one saw him.
She came out of the Baker's and looked in her pram a saw the baby asleep.
She went home <ERR targ=and> a </ERR> while the baby was <ERR targ=asleep> a sleep </ERR> she done some jobs.
When she had done her jobs she said to herself "the <ERR targ=baby> babys </ERR> is having a long sleep.
I go and see if he is still asleep.
She opened the <ERR targ=door> down </ERR> and she <ERR targ=saw> sow </ERR> a black baby sitting in her pram she shouted.

The police said they would be here in a very few <ERR targ=minutes> minetes </ERR> .
As soon as she had a knock on the door, she said "Come in," it was the policemen.
The police said, "What can we do for you Miss.
So she said "This is not my baby I had a white one so the police said when did you first find out she said just a minute ago.
Just before before I phoned you.
One of the police said "did you leave it <ERR targ=outside> out side </ERR> a shop, and she said "yes while I went in the  baker's .
(she was crying) The other policeman said.

 AN APPLE
It comes off of a tree when you pick it is rosy red and before you eat it makes your mouth water it even makes your mouth water when you hear the name  gascoyne's scarlet.
when you go scrumping and when you get caught it is worth taking the chance of getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples.
when you go scrumping you have got to be <ERR targ=careful> carefull </ERR> you don't get caught if you do get caught the man will be waiting for you next time you go to get some more gascoyne scarlet apples.
when I go scrumping all I go after is apples and plums, pears.
when you go pinching <ERR targ=apples> apple </ERR> you do not want to take <ERR targ=too> to </ERR> many people or you will not get away so quick when there are a lot of people with you <ERR targ=especially> a specally </ERR> little boys they make too much noise.
If you pick apples off of the ground you have to be <ERR targ=careful> carful </ERR> of the wasps or else they will sting you and the sting comes up to a big bump <ERR targ=wherever> where ever </ERR> it stings you.
when you are by yourself and <ERR targ=someone> some one </ERR> comes and you have to climb over the <ERR targ=barbed> barb </ERR> wire and get caught the man will <ERR targ=probably> probally </ERR> catch you but if someone else is with you they can unhook you.
some people when <ERR targ=they> the </ERR> catch you they might hit you and <ERR targ=say> said </ERR> he will hit you harder next time he catches you.
But some people say they will hit you next time but warn you not to come in the orchard again But the children could not resist getting some more apples to eat.
It is best getting apples from an orchard where there are no houses.
when I go scrumping I do not take bikes because the man who owns the orchard might come along and take the bikes and if you want your bike you have to go and ask for it and that is how the owner of the orchard knows that you were in the orchard.
I never take a dark jacket or a red one because you will be <ERR targ=recognized> reconnised </ERR> very easy because red shows up very easy.
But still it is worth getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples.

 The Fox The fox is a sly old beast He sits in his den cleaning and waiting To make <ERR targ=another> a nother </ERR> savage attack He walks the field to the farm The smell of chickens in the passing breeze.
he's gone to collect his meal.
He makes a leap.
Chickens cackle as the fox collects his meal.

 WINTER When the snow lay round about The robins come out to seek crumbs Their feet are numb But the snow still lies round about.
A tree is a place for song That's where birds sing their sweet song.
The leaves have gone.
It will not be long before the tree has gone.

 <ERR targ=Stranded> Stranden </ERR> on a Desert Island
One <ERR targ=midsummer> midsummer's </ERR> day at 9.30 a.m.
a ship was wrecked by a <ERR targ=coral> corral </ERR> reef so people jumped overboard.
People who could not swim did not know it was a case of life or death The ship was sinking fast but some still hung on.
the shore was only about a mile away so some began to swim to the shore.
Getting food from the ship was impossible but some people on the ship could get down to the store room and get some diving <ERR targ=outfits> out fits </ERR> .
So one man <ERR targ=volunteered> volonteered </ERR> to swim out to the ship and go down to the store room.
<ERR targ=There> Their </ERR> were dead <ERR targ=bodies> bodys </ERR> on the deck within 20 minutes of the <ERR targ=shipwreck> ship wreck </ERR> .
<ERR targ=There> Their </ERR> were 1 or 2 live people on board but he was frightened to go on the island.
The man who swam from the island went down to the store room.
He held his breath as he went down below the surface of the water.
As he <ERR targ=opened> open </ERR> the store room door the water gushed in very quickly.
So he had to feel for the diving suits.
He brought as many as he could find to the surface and that was only 5.
He got up in the crows nest and waved to the people on the island so they sent <ERR targ=two> to </ERR> men to help him.
When they arrived they all put their diving suits on <ERR targ=then> the </ERR> went down to get some food.
<ERR targ=Lucky> Luckily </ERR> enough it was mostly <ERR targ=tinned> tin </ERR> food.
They brought quite a lot up for the people on the island.
When looking around the deck they saw a <ERR targ=lifeboat> life boat </ERR> but it had a little hole in one side but they thought it would be good enough take the food to the island in.
They all had one tin of something each.
They all ate this just like pigs feeding out of a trough.
After they had their tin of food to eat people were still hungry so they started looking for coconuts.
They all decided that there would only be two meals a day.
most of them agreed but of course there were some who protested.
There was about 35 on the island but people who <ERR targ=used> use't </ERR> to get coconuts <ERR targ=usually> usally </ERR> got lost or got bitten by a snake.
They had <ERR targ=shortened> shortend </ERR> <ERR targ=down> done </ERR> from 35 to 15.
They kept near the coast so they could go in the sea if they wanted to.
And they could also catch fish to eat.
After several weeks ships had seen them waving but took no notice of them In september food was running short so they <ERR targ=killed> kill </ERR> animals and drank fresh water from springs.
they found here and there.
they found coconuts while hunting for animals.
They took the coconuts down to the shore and drained the milk out and ate the rest of the inside.
They caught quite a few tigers in traps which are holes dug in the <ERR targ=ground> gound </ERR> and sticks <ERR targ=laid> laide </ERR> across with grass on top of them.
At night they slept all together under coconut trees.
They were not surprised to see somebody dead in the morning.
One morning in december a ship was going across the sea to England they waved and waved again.
Then the ship began to turn and was coming to fetch them they were all delighted.
As soon <ERR targ=as> ass </ERR> they arrived on board the sailors told them to report to the  captain's  office.
They all too pleased to be on board a ship again the captain said how did you get on that island they replied we were shipwrecked in June and we have been there since.
They arrived in England 2 days later and how glad they were to be back in England again.
