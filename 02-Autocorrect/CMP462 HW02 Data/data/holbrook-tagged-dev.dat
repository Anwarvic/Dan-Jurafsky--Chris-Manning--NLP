 My family
There are Eight of us in my family counting my mother and <ERR targ=Father> Farther </ERR> .
I have two sisters, one Janet one Edna.
Three brothers Terry <ERR targ=Stuart> Sturt </ERR> and <ERR targ=Geoff> Goef </ERR> .
I think my family is awful because I get blamed for <ERR targ=nearly> nely </ERR> everything if one of my brothers hit <ERR targ=anyone> any own </ERR> else I get all the blame.

 I got a bag nearly <ERR targ=full> ful </ERR> and then I <ERR targ=saw> soor </ERR> a man with a gun coming across the <ERR targ=meadow> meddow </ERR> after me, I put my bag over my shoulder and run, the old man come after me he <ERR targ=said> seid </ERR> stop or else I will blow your <ERR targ=head> hed </ERR> right off.
I said shut your gob and I took two apples out of my bag and through them at him, one hit him in the guts and hit him on the bonce, he fell <ERR targ=to> too </ERR> the ground and lay there, and I said to <ERR targ=myself> my self </ERR> <ERR targ=that's> thats </ERR> a good Job now I can eat my apples.

 LEAVING SCHOOL
When I <ERR targ=leave> leav </ERR> school I am going to work up the petrol pumps at Mr Sturgess's at Mording.
I work up there at <ERR targ=weekends> weekend </ERR> and in the holidays.
I like working up there because I meet all kinds of people.
They have a farm attached to it they keep a few pigs up the farm and a few down the road in a meadow.
They have a tractor and a trailer.
<ERR targ=There> They </ERR> are two brothers Frank and John.
John is my boss.
Frank has four cars two which go and two which do not go.
John owns the tractor and trailer and all the pigs and a cattle lorry and Frank owns one bullock one cow and one <ERR targ=heifer> effer </ERR> .

 THE FARM
When I go up the farm on saturday morning I go down the yard and start up the tractor, and back the trailer on and go up the yard, then clean the pigs out with John, then the lorry.
Then we go back down the yard and unload the dung.
Then I started the tractor up <ERR targ=again> a gain </ERR> , and went out on <ERR targ=to> too </ERR> the <ERR targ=field> fild </ERR> .
Then we <ERR targ=uncovered> an cafferd </ERR> some <ERR targ=mangels> manggles </ERR> , and loaded them up we got three <ERR targ=loads> loades </ERR> before dinner from about 11.30 until about 1. <ERR targ=o'clock> oclock </ERR> .
When we come back from dinner we started the tractor up again and went for <ERR targ=another> a nother </ERR> load, we got <ERR targ=four> for </ERR> more <ERR targ=loads> loades </ERR> before tea the last one we <ERR targ=got> go </ERR> stuck with.
But we soon got out of <ERR targ=that> theat </ERR> when John put some bricks under the wheels This is the tractor <ERR targ=which> witch </ERR> I drive at <ERR targ=weekends> week ends </ERR> , and in the holidays.
You have to start it by a handle and you have to turn the petrol on and when you get it going you have to let it warm up first and then turn it on to T.V.O.
Then away you go.
It is a low <ERR targ=geared> gird </ERR> tractor it has three <ERR targ=forward> fowd </ERR> <ERR targ=gears> girse </ERR> and 1 <ERR targ=reverse> reveirse </ERR> .
It has <ERR targ=four> for </ERR> <ERR targ=cylinders> silinders </ERR> and a <ERR targ=hydraulic> high drollit </ERR> lift. the <ERR targ=manifold> many fold </ERR> <ERR targ=has> as </ERR> burnt out so smoke and flames and sparks fly out of the <ERR targ=bottom> botton </ERR> of it.
if you fill the <ERR targ=radiator> radyator </ERR> up with water it will last for 10 minutes <ERR targ=because> becouse </ERR> it has a hole in the bottom of it as big round as a sixpence.

 The Sick Sow.
Last week I went up the farm and Bill told me that he had just bought a black and white sow.
He said it fed all right for the first three days, but now she won't feed <ERR targ=at all> a tall </ERR> .
So I said let me come and look at <ERR targ=her> here </ERR> , so we went and had a look at <ERR targ=her> here </ERR> , and she was lame on the <ERR targ=her> here </ERR> right, front leg.

 The Old Bull
One day I went round old man <ERR targ=Jones's> Joneses </ERR> farm and he and some of his <ERR targ=workmen> work men </ERR> had got the bull out in the yard.
As I went in the gate the old bull started to <ERR targ=turn> tern </ERR> on me, so old man Jones, said get behind that old cart Joe.
About 4 or 5 minutes after, I came out from behind the cart.
They had got the old bull back in the shed.
Then he asked me if I would <ERR targ=help> held </ERR> him bring daisy the old cow up to go with the old bull, because he thinks that she ought to have a nothing calf.
So he put <ERR targ=her> here </ERR> in with old Toogey the bull he got on <ERR targ=her> here </ERR> back and we let him stay with <ERR targ=her> here </ERR> <ERR targ=for> fore </ERR> about half of an hour.
About four to five month after she had been with the old bull she had a calf it was a bull calf.
When it was about ten weeks old, when we sold it it made #15.10s.6d.
Then the time came for the old bull to be sold he was <ERR targ=too> to </ERR> old and fat for the old cows.
So we took him down tonbury market and he made #85.10/6d <ERR targ=alive> alife </ERR> he <ERR targ=weighed> wade </ERR> one and a half tons.

 1.
A brown study means when <ERR targ=someone> some one </ERR> is in a sort of dream or a sulk.
2.
Fighting with your own shadow.
3.
The snow which the geese drip on the ground are feathers.
4.
To <ERR targ=grieve> greive </ERR> like a goose.
