'''Andrew Johnson''' (December 29, 1808 – July 31, 1875) was the seventeenth [[President of the United States]] (1865-69), succeeding to the Presidency upon [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|the assassination]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]].  He was one of only two [[Impeachment in the United States|U.S. Presidents to be impeached]].

At the time of the [[Ordinance of Secession|secession of the Southern states]], Johnson was a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Greeneville, Tennessee|Greeneville in eastern Tennessee]]. As a Unionist, he was the only southern Senator not to quit his post upon secession.  He became the most prominent [[War Democrat]] from the South and supported the military policies of US President Abraham Lincoln during the [[American Civil War]] of 1861–1865. In 1862 Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of occupied Tennessee, where he proved to be energetic and effective in fighting the rebellion and beginning transition to Reconstruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britanica1&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9043849/Andrew-Johnson 'Andrew Johnson'], [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was nominated for the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] slot in 1864 on the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]] ticket.  He and Lincoln were [[United States presidential election, 1864|elected in November 1864]].  Johnson succeeded to the Presidency upon Lincoln's assassination on April 15, 1865.

As president he took charge of Presidential Reconstruction{{ndash}} the first phase of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]{{ndash}} which lasted until the [[Radical Republican (USA)|Radical Republican]]s gained control of Congress in the 1866 elections. His conciliatory policies towards the South, his hurry to reincorporate the former Confederates back into the union, and his vetoes of civil rights bills embroiled him in a bitter dispute with some Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Legal History |last=Hall |first=Kermit |coauthors=Paul Finkelman, James W. Ely |year=2005 |edition=3rd edition |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-516225-0 |pages=259-260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Radicals in the [[History of the United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] impeached him in 1868 while charging him with violating the [[Tenure of Office Act]], a law enacted by Congress in March 1867 over Johnson's veto, but he was acquitted by a single vote in the [[History of the United States Senate|Senate]].

==Early life==
[[Image:DSCF0857.JPG|thumb|left|Reconstruction of Johnson's boyhood home in [[North Carolina]], located at the [[Andrew Johnson National Historic Site]] in [[Greeneville, Tennessee]].]]
Johnson was born on December 29, 1808, in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], to [[Jacob Johnson (father of Andrew Johnson)|Jacob Johnson]] and Mary McDonough.  Andrew Johnson's father, Jacob, died when Andrew was around three years old, leaving his family in poverty.  Johnson's mother then took in work [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[weaving]] to support her family and later remarried.  She bound Andrew as an apprentice tailor when he was 14 or 10.&lt;ref&gt;14 according to ''Britannica'', 10 according to Karin L Zipf&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1820s, he worked as a tailor in [[Laurens, South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?MarkerID=10133 Laurens Historic District historical marker]&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson never attended any type of school and taught himself how to read and spell.

At age 16 or 17 Johnson broke his [[apprenticeship]] and ran away with his brother to [[Greeneville, Tennessee]], where he found work as a tailor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britanica1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karin L Zipf. ''Labor Of Innocents: Forced Apprenticeship in North Carolina, 1715–1919'' (2005) pp 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 18, Johnson married [[Eliza McCardle Johnson|Eliza McCardle]] in 1827.  Between 1828 and 1852, the couple had five children: Martha (1828), Charles (1830), Mary (1832), Robert (1834), and Andrew Jr. (1852).&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;/&gt;  Eliza taught Johnson arithmetic and also tutored him to improve his literacy and writing skills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britanica1&quot; /&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;left&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- for boyhood home photo --&gt;

==Early political career==
Johnson participated in debates at the local academy at Greeneville, Tennessee&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse1&quot;&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/aj17.html Biography of Andrew Johnson]{{ndash}} www.whitehouse.gov&lt;/ref&gt; and later organized a workingman's party that elected him as [[alderman]] in 1829.  He served in this position until he was elected mayor in 1833.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britanica1&quot;/&gt; In 1835 he was elected to the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]] where, after serving a single term, he was defeated for re-election.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ajmuseum.tusculum.edu/?page_id=6|title=The Andrew Johnson Collection|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070607123406/http://ajmuseum.tusculum.edu/ajcollect.html |archivedate=2007-06-07}} [http://www2.tusculum.edu/ajmuseum/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/timeline_master.pdf Timeline of President Andrew Johnson's Life (PDF)] from the website of the President [http://ajmuseum.tusculum.edu/ Andrew Johnson Museum and Library] at [[Tusculum College]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was attracted to [[Andrew Jackson]]'s states' rights Democratic Party.  He became a spokesman for the more numerous yeomen farmers and mountaineers against the wealthier, but fewer, planter elite families that had held political control both in the state and nationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britanica1&quot;/&gt;  In 1839 Johnson was elected to the [[Tennessee Senate]], where he served two consecutive two-year terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;/&gt;  In 1843 he became the first Democrat to win election as the U.S. Representative from [[Tennessee's 1st congressional district]]. Among his activities for the common man's interests as a member of the House of Representatives and the Senate, Johnson advocated 'a free farm for the poor' bill where farms would be given to landless farmers.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse1&quot;/&gt; Johnson was a U.S. Representative for five terms until 1853, when he was elected governor of Tennessee.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;/&gt;

==Political ascendancy==
[[Image:Younger Andrew Johnson.jpg|thumb|right|Pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] photo of Johnson.]]
Johnson was elected governor of Tennessee, serving from 1853 to 1857.  He was then elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate, serving from October 8, 1857 to March 4, 1862. He was chairman of the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expense ([[36th United States Congress|Thirty-sixth Congress]]).  Before Tennessee voted on secession, Johnson{{ndash}} who lived in Unionist east Tennessee{{ndash}} toured the state speaking in opposition to the act, which he said was unconstitutional.  Johnson was an aggressive stump speaker and often responded to hecklers, even those in the Senate.  At the time of [[secession]] of [[Confederate States of America|the Confederacy]], Johnson was the only Senator from the seceded states to continue participation in Congress.  His explanation for this decision was &quot;Damn the negroes, I am fighting those traitorous aristocrats, their masters.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britanica1&quot; /&gt;

Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of occupied Tennessee in March 1862 with the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britanica1&quot; /&gt; During his three years in this office, he &quot;moved resolutely to eradicate all pro-Confederate influences in the state.&quot;  This &quot;unwavering commitment to the Union&quot; was a significant factor in his choice as vice-president by Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;Sledge pg. 1071-1072&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson vigorously suppressed the Confederates and later spoke out for black suffrage, arguing, &quot;The better class of them will go to work and sustain themselves, and that class ought to be allowed to vote, on the ground that a loyal [[negro]] is more worthy than a disloyal white man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Patton p 126&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition and local lore, on August 8, 1863, Johnson freed his personal slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12586299 &quot;Tennessee Recalls Emancipation, Segregation&quot;], National Public Radio&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vice presidency===
As a leading [[War Democrat]] and pro-Union southerner, Johnson was an ideal candidate for the Republicans in 1864 as they enlarged their base to include War Democrats.  They changed the party name to the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]] to reflect this expansion. During the election Johnson replaced [[Hannibal Hamlin]] as Lincoln's running mate. He was elected [[Vice President of the United States]] and was inaugurated March 4, 1865. At the ceremony, Johnson, who had been drinking to offset the pain of [[typhoid fever]] (as he explained later), gave a rambling speech and appeared intoxicated to many.  In early 1865, Johnson talked harshly of hanging traitors like [[Jefferson Davis]], which endeared him to the Radicals.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lincoln assassination====
{{main|Abraham Lincoln assassination}}
On April 14, 1865, Abraham Lincoln was shot and mortally wounded by [[John Wilkes Booth]], a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizer, while the President was attending a play at [[Ford's Theater]].  Booth's plan was to destroy the administration by ordering conspirators to assassinate Johnson and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] that same night.  Seward narrowly survived his wounds, while Johnson escaped attack as his would-be assassin, [[George Atzerodt]], failed to go through with the plan.

==Presidency 1865–1869==
[[Image:Andrew Johnson.jpg|thumb|Engraving of Johnson]]
The morning after Lincoln's assassination, Johnson was sworn in as President of the United States on April 15, 1865 by Lincoln's newly appointed [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Salmon P. Chase]]. Johnson was the first Vice President to succeed to the U.S. Presidency upon the [[assassination]] of a President and the third vice president to become a president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australianpolitics.com/usa/president/presidents-list.shtml Complete list of U.S. presidents]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse1&quot;/&gt;

Johnson had an ambiguous party status. He attempted to build a party of loyalists under the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union]] label, but he did not identify with the two main parties while President&amp;mdash;though he did try for the Democratic nomination in 1868. Asked in 1868 why he did not become a Democrat, he said &quot;It is true I am asked why don't I join the Democratic Party. Why don't they join me...if I have administered the office of president so well?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse, Hans Louis. ''Andrew Johnson: A Biography'' (1997), p. 338-339.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction===
{{main|Reconstruction era of the United States}}
[[Image:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|thumb|A political cartoon of Andrew Johnson and Abraham Lincoln, 1865.  The caption reads (Johnson): ''Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever.'' (Lincoln): ''A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended.'']]
Northern anger over the assassination of Lincoln and the immense human cost of the war led to demands for harsh policies. Vice President Andrew Johnson had taken a hard line and spoke of hanging rebel Confederates. In late April, 1865 he was noted telling an Indiana delegation that, &quot;Treason must be made odious... traitors must be punished and impoverished ... their social power must be destroyed.&quot; However, when he succeeded Lincoln as President, Johnson took a much softer line noting, &quot;I say, as to the leaders, punishment. I also say leniency, reconciliation and amnesty to the thousands whom they have misled and deceived.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Milton 183&lt;/ref&gt; and ended up pardoning many Confederate leaders and ex-Confederates to maintain their control of Southern state governments, Southern lands, and black people.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse, Hans L. Andrew Johnson: A Biography (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

His class-based resentment of the rich appeared in a May 1865 statement to W.H. Holden, the man he appointed governor of North Carolina: &quot;I intend to confiscate the lands of these rich men whom I have excluded from pardon by my proclamation, and divide the proceeds thereof among the families of the wool hat boys, the Confederate soldiers, whom these men forced into battle to protect their property in slaves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/holden/holden.html &quot;Memoirs of W.W. Holden: Electronic Edition&quot;.]&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, Johnson was not at all harsh toward the Confederate leaders.  He allowed the Southern states to hold elections in 1865, resulting in prominent ex-Confederates being elected to the U.S. Congress; however, Congress did not seat them. Congress and Johnson argued in an increasingly public way about [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and the manner in which the Southern secessionist states would be readmitted to the Union. Johnson favored a very quick restoration, similar to the plan of leniency that Lincoln advocated before his death.

===Break with the Republicans: 1866===
Johnson-appointed governments all passed [[Black Codes in the USA|Black Codes]] that gave the [[Freedmen]] second class status. In response to the Black Codes and worrisome signs of Southern recalcitrance, the Radical Republicans blocked the re-admission of the ex-rebellious states to the Congress in fall 1865. Congress also renewed the [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands|Freedman's Bureau]], but Johnson vetoed it.  Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]] of Illinois, leader of the moderate Republicans, took affront at the Black Codes. Trumbull proposed the first Civil Rights bill.

Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the Civil Rights bill, Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27. His veto message objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the Freedmen at a time when eleven out of thirty-six States were unrepresented and attempted to fix by Federal law &quot;a perfect equality of the white and black races in every State of the Union.&quot; Johnson said it was an invasion by Federal authority of the rights of the States; it had no warrant in the Constitution and was contrary to all precedents. It was a &quot;stride toward centralization and the concentration of all legislative power in the national government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, ''History'' 6:68&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson, in a letter to Governor Thomas C. Fletcher of Missouri, wrote, &quot;This is a country for white men, and by God, as long as I am President, it shall be a government for white men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Trefousse pg. 236. Online reference to the quote available at http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/grant/peopleevents/e_impeach.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democratic Party, proclaiming itself the party of white men, north and South, aligned with Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse 1999&lt;/ref&gt; However the Republicans in Congress overrode his veto (the Senate by the vote of 33:15, the House by 182:41) and the Civil Rights bill became law.

The last moderate proposal was the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], also authored by moderate Trumbull.  It was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but it went much further. It extended citizenship to everyone born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to Freedmen, and most importantly, created new Federal civil rights that could be protected by Federal courts. It guaranteed the Federal war debt (and promised the Confederate debt would never be paid).  Johnson used his influence to block the amendment in the states, as three-fourths of the states were required for ratification. (The Amendment was later ratified.)

The moderate effort to compromise with Johnson had failed and an all-out political war broke out between the Republicans (both Radical and moderate) on one side, and on the other Johnson and his allies in the Democratic party in the North, and the conservative groupings in the South.  The decisive battle was the [[United States House election, 1866|election of 1866]]. Johnson campaigned vigorously but was widely ridiculed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usa-presidents.info/speeches/cleveland-speech.html Andrew Johnson Cleveland Speech (September 3, 1866)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Republicans won by a landslide (the Southern states were not allowed to vote), and took full control of Reconstruction. Johnson was almost powerless.

Historian [[James Ford Rhodes]] has explained Johnson's inability to engage in serious negotiations:&lt;blockquote&gt;
As Senator [[Charles Sumner]] shrewdly said, &quot;the President himself is his own worst counselor, as he is his own worst defender.&quot;  Johnson acted in accordance with his nature. He had intellectual force but it worked in a groove. Obstinate rather than firm it undoubtedly seemed to him that following counsel and making concessions were a display of weakness. At all events from his December message to the veto of the Civil Rights Bill he yielded not a jot to Congress. The moderate senators and representatives (who constituted a majority of the Union party) asked him for only a slight compromise; their action was really an entreaty that he would unite with them to preserve Congress and the country from the policy of the radicals.
The two projects which Johnson had most at heart were the speedy admission of the Southern senators and representatives to Congress and the relegation of the question of 'negro suffrage' to the States themselves. Himself shrinking from the imposition on these communities of the franchise for the colored people, his unyielding position in regard to matters involving no vital principle did much to bring it about. His quarrel with Congress prevented the readmission into the Union on generous terms of the members of the late Confederacy; and for the quarrel and its unhappy results Johnson's lack of imagination and his inordinate sensitiveness to political gadflies were largely responsible: it was not a contest in which fundamentals were involved.
He sacrificed two important objects to petty considerations. His pride of opinion, his desire to beat, blinded him to the real welfare of the South and of the whole country.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, ''History'' 6:74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Andew Johnson impeachment trial.jpg|thumb|[[Theodore R. Davis]]' illustration of Johnson's  impeachment trial in the [[United States Senate]], published in ''Harper's Weekly''.]]
===Impeachment===
====First attempt====
There were two attempts to remove President Andrew Johnson from office. The first occurred in the fall of 1867. On November 21, 1867, the House Judiciary committee produced a bill of impeachment that consisted of a vast collection of complaints against him. After a furious debate, a formal vote was held in the House of Representatives on December 5, 1867, which failed 108-57.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse, 1989 pages 302–3&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second attempt====
{{main|Impeachment of Andrew Johnson}}
[[Image:AJohnsonimpeach.jpg|thumb|The 1868 Impeachment Resolution]]
Johnson notified Congress that he had removed [[Edwin Stanton]] as Secretary of War and was replacing him in the interim with Adjutant-General [[Lorenzo Thomas]]. Johnson had wanted to replace Stanton with former General [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who refused to accept the position.  This violated the [[Tenure of Office Act]], a law enacted by Congress in March 1867 over Johnson's veto, specifically designed to protect Stanton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9071723/Tenure-of-Office-Act Tenure of office act{{ndash}} Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson had vetoed the act, claiming it was unconstitutional. The act said, &quot;...every person holding any civil office, to which he has been appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate ... shall be entitled to hold such office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed and duly qualified,&quot; thus removing the President's previous unlimited power to remove any of his Cabinet members at will. Years later in the case ''[[Myers v. United States]]'' in 1926, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that such laws were indeed unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9380467/Tenure-of-Office-Act Tenure of office act{{ndash}} Britannica Concise]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate and House entered into debate. Thomas attempted to move into the war office, for which Stanton had Thomas arrested. Three days after Stanton's removal, the House [[impeachment|impeached]] Johnson for intentionally violating the Tenure of Office Act.

On March 5, 1868, a court of impeachment was constituted in the Senate to hear charges against the President. [[William M. Evarts]] served as his counsel. Eleven articles were set out in the resolution, and the trial before the Senate lasted almost three months. Johnson's defense was based on a clause in the Tenure of Office Act stating that the then-current secretaries would hold their posts throughout the term of the President who appointed them. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, it was claimed, the applicability of the act had already run its course.
[[Image:The situation.jpg|thumb|left|''The Situation''&lt;br/&gt;A ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' cartoon gives a humorous breakdown of &quot;the situation&quot;. [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin Stanton]] aims a cannon labeled &quot;Congress&quot; on the side at [[President of the United States|President]] Johnson and [[Lorenzo Thomas]] to show how Stanton was using congress to defeat the president and his unsuccessful replacement. He also holds a rammer marked &quot;Tenure of Office Bill&quot; and cannon balls on the floor are marked &quot;Justice&quot;. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and an unidentified man stand to Stanton's left.]]

There were three votes in the Senate: one on May 16 for the 11th article of impeachment, which included many of the charges contained in the other articles, and two on May 26 for the second and third articles, after which the trial adjourned. On all three occasions, thirty-five Senators voted &quot;guilty&quot; and nineteen &quot;not guilty.&quot; As the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority for conviction in impeachment trials, Johnson was acquitted; the 35-19 vote was one less then the majority required. A single changed vote for guilty would have convicted and removed Johnson from office.  Seven Republican senators were disturbed by how the proceedings had been manipulated in order to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence. Senators [[William Pitt Fessenden]], [[Joseph S. Fowler]], [[James W. Grimes]], [[John B. Henderson]], [[Lyman Trumbull]], [[Peter G. Van Winkle]],&lt;ref&gt; [http://law.jrank.org/pages/13490/Andrew-Johnson-Trial.html &quot;Andrew Johnson Trial: The Consciences of Seven Republicans Save Johnson&quot;.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edmund G. Ross]] of Kansas, who provided the decisive vote,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/john.htm &quot;The Trial of Andrew Johnson, 1868&quot;.]&lt;/ref&gt; defied their party and public opinion and voted against conviction.

Before 1960 most historians held the impeachment of Andrew Johnson as a violation of American values regarding division of powers and fair play.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} Had Johnson been successfully removed from office, he would have been replaced with [[Radical Republican (USA)|Radical Republican]] [[Benjamin Wade]], making the presidency and Congress somewhat uniform in ideology, although in many ways Wade was more &quot;radical&quot; than the Republicans in Congress.  This would have established a precedent that a President could be removed not for &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors,&quot; but for purely political differences.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}
{{clr}}
===Christmas Day amnesty for Confederates===
One of Johnson's last significant acts was granting unconditional [[amnesty]] to all Confederates on Christmas Day, December 25, 1868. This was after the election of U.S. Grant to succeed him, but before Grant took office in March 1869. Earlier amnesties requiring signed oaths and excluding certain classes of people were issued both by Lincoln and by Johnson.

===States admitted to the Union===
*[[Nebraska]] - March 1, 1867


===Foreign policy===
Johnson forced the [[France|French]] out of [[Mexico]] by sending a combat army to the border and issuing an ultimatum. The French withdrew in 1867, and the government they supported quickly collapsed. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward|Seward]] negotiated the [[Alaska purchase|purchase of Alaska]] from Russia on April 9, 1867 for $7.2 million. Critics sneered at &quot;[[Seward's Folly]]&quot; and &quot;Seward's Icebox&quot; and &quot;Icebergia.&quot; Seward also negotiated to purchase the [[Danish West Indies]], but the Senate refused to approve the purchase in 1867 (it eventually happened in 1917). The Senate likewise rejected Seward's arrangement with the United Kingdom to arbitrate the [[Alabama Claims|''Alabama'' Claims]].

The U.S. experienced tense relations with the United Kingdom and its colonial government in Canada in the aftermath of the war. Lingering resentment over the perception of British sympathy towards the Confederacy resulted in Johnson initially turning a blind eye towards a series of armed incursions by Irish-American civil war veterans into British territory in Canada, named the [[Fenian Raids]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fenian&quot;&gt;[http://www.doyle.com.au/fenian_raids.htm The Fenian Raids]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Johnson ordered the Fenians disarmed and barred from crossing the border, but his hesitant reaction to the crisis helped motivate the movement toward [[Canadian Confederation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fenian&quot; /&gt;

==Post-presidency==
[[Image:Andrew Johnson House Greeneville year1886 153142pu.png|thumb|The Johnson home in [[Greeneville, Tennessee]] 1886, today restored and known as the [[Andrew Johnson National Historic Site]].]]
Johnson was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the United States Senate from Tennessee in 1868 and to the House of Representatives in 1872. However, in 1874 the Tennessee legislature did elect him to the U.S. Senate. Johnson served from March 4, 1875, until his death from a stroke near [[Elizabethton, Tennessee]], on July 31 that same year. In his first speech since returning to the Senate, which was also his last, Johnson spoke about political turmoil in Louisiana.&lt;ref name=&quot;senate&quot;&gt;[http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Death_of_Andrew_Johnson.htm United States Senate: Death of Andrew Johnson]&lt;/ref&gt;  His passion aroused a standing ovation from many of his fellow senators who had once voted to remove him from the presidency.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} He is the only former President to serve in the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;senate&quot; /&gt;

Interment was in the Andrew Johnson National Cemetery, [[Greeneville, Tennessee]], where he was buried with a copy of the Constitution. Andrew Johnson National Cemetery is now part of the [[Andrew Johnson National Historic Site]].

==Historians' changing views on Andrew Johnson==
The [[Dunning School]] of the early 20th century saw Johnson as a heroic bulwark against the corruption of the Radical Republicans who tried to remove the entire leadership class of the white South. In their view, Johnson seemed to be the legitimate heir of the sainted Abraham Lincoln.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

By the 1930s a series of favorable biographies enhanced his prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Highly favorable were Winston (1928), Stryker (1929), Milton (1930), and Claude Bowers, ''The Tragic Era'' (1929).&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson's Republican critics of the 1860s appeared as disreputable to liberal historians as did the Republican critics of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Furthermore, a Beardian School (named after [[Charles Beard]] and typified by [[Howard K. Beale]]) argued that the Republican Party in the 1860s was a tool of corrupt business interests, and that Johnson stood for the people. Historian Eric Foner says that by 1948, historians regarded Reconstruction, &quot;as a time of corruption and misgovernment caused by granting black men the right to vote.&quot; They rated Johnson &quot;near great.&quot; but have later changed their minds, rating Johnson &quot;a flat failure&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WpostWorst&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/01/AR2006120101509_pf.html Washington Post Dec. 1, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Civil Rights movement]] of the 1960s brought a new perspective to the practice of history as well as to civil legislation. Historians noted African American efforts to establish public education and welfare institutions, gave muted praise for Republican efforts to extend suffrage and provide other social institutions, and excoriated Johnson for siding with the opposition to extending basic rights to former slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;WpostWorst&quot;/&gt;

Johnson's [[purchase of Alaska]] from the [[Russian Empire]] in 1867 is believed to be a most important foreign policy action, with the purchase proving itself vital to national security during the [[Cold War]] (mid-1940s until the early 1990s).{{Fact|date=February 2008}} The idea and implementation is credited to Seward as Secretary of State, but Johnson approved the plan.  Gold was not discovered in Alaska until 1880, thirteen years after the purchase and five years after Johnson's death, and oil was not discovered until 1968.

{{For|the Attorney General of Maryland|Edgar Allan Poe (Maryland Attorney General)}}
'''Edgar Allan Poe''' (January 19, 1809&amp;nbsp;– October 7, 1849) was an American [[Poetry|poet]], [[Short story|short-story]] [[writer]], [[Editing|editor]] and [[literary critic]], and is considered part of the American [[Romanticism|Romantic Movement]]. Best known for his tales of [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] and the [[macabre]], Poe was one of the earliest American practitioners of the short story and is considered the inventor of the [[Detective fiction|detective-fiction]] genre. He is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of [[science fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Stableford, Brian. &quot;Science fiction before the genre.&quot; ''The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction'', Eds. Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn. Cambridge: Cambridge University of Press, 2003. pp. 18&amp;nbsp;– 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.&lt;ref name = Meyers138/&gt;

Born as Edgar Poe in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], Poe's parents died when he was young. Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan, of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]], but they never formally adopted him. After spending a short period at the [[University of Virginia]] and briefly attempting a military career, Poe and the Allans parted ways. Poe's publishing career began humbly, with an anonymous collection of poems, ''[[Tamerlane and Other Poems]]'' (1827), credited only to &quot;a Bostonian&quot;.

Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move between several cities, including [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and [[New York City]]. In Baltimore in 1835, he married [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Clemm]], his 13-year-old cousin. In January 1845, Poe published his poem &quot;[[The Raven]]&quot; to instant success. His wife died of [[tuberculosis]] two years later. He began planning to produce his own journal, ''The Penn'' (later renamed ''[[The Stylus]]''), though he died before it could be produced. On October 7, 1849, at age 40, Poe died in Baltimore; the cause of his death is unknown and has been attributed to alcohol, brain congestion, [[cholera]], drugs, [[heart disease]], [[rabies]], suicide, tuberculosis, and other agents.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 256&lt;/ref&gt;

Poe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world, as well as in specialized fields, such as [[cosmology]] and [[cryptography]]. Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today.

==Life and career==
[[Image:Edgar Allan Poe Birthplace Boston.jpg|thumb|left|This plaque marks the approximate location where Edgar Poe was born in Boston.]]
===Early life===
Born Edgar Poe in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], on January 19, 1809, the second child of actress [[Eliza Poe|Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe]] and actor David Poe, Jr. He had an elder brother, [[William Henry Leonard Poe]], and a younger sister, Rosalie Poe.&lt;ref name=&quot;hervey&quot;&gt;Allen, Hervey. &quot;Introduction&quot;. ''The Works of Edgar Allan Poe'', New York: P. F. Collier &amp; Son, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; Edgar may have been named after a character in [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] ''[[King Lear]]'', a play the couple was performing in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Randy F. ''The Almanac of American Letters''. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 65. ISBN 086576008X&lt;/ref&gt; His father abandoned their family in 1810,&lt;ref name = father&gt;Canada, Mark, ed. &quot;[http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/allam/17841865/lit/poe.htm Edgar Allan Poe Chronology]&quot;. ''Canada's America''. 1997. Retrieved on June 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother died a year later from [[tuberculosis|consumption]]. Poe was then taken into the home of John Allan, a successful Scottish merchant in [[Richmond, Virginia]], who dealt in a variety of goods including tobacco, cloth, wheat, tombstones, and [[slavery|slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 8&lt;/ref&gt; The Allans served as a foster family but never formally adopted Poe,&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 61&lt;/ref&gt; though they gave him the name &quot;Edgar Allan Poe&quot;.&lt;ref name=Meyers9&gt;Meyers, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allan family had Poe baptized in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] in 1812. John Allan alternately spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster son.&lt;ref name=Meyers9/&gt; The family, including Poe and Allan's wife, Frances Valentine Allan, sailed to England in 1815. Poe attended the grammar school in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]], Scotland (where John Allan was born) for a short period in 1815, before rejoining the family in London in 1816. He studied at a boarding school in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] until summer 1817. He was subsequently entered at the Reverend John Bransby’s Manor House School at [[Stoke Newington]], then a suburb four&amp;nbsp;miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) north of London.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 16&amp;nbsp;– 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Poe moved back with the Allans to Richmond, Virginia in 1820. In March 1825, John Allan's uncle&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 20&lt;/ref&gt; and business benefactor William Galt, said to be one of the wealthiest men in Richmond, died and left Allan several acres of real estate. The inheritance was estimated at $750,000. By summer 1825, Allan celebrated his expansive wealth by purchasing a two-story brick home named Moldavia.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 27&amp;nbsp;– 28&lt;/ref&gt; Poe may have become engaged to [[Sarah Elmira Royster]] before he registered at the one-year old [[University of Virginia]] in February 1826 to study languages.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 29&amp;nbsp;– 30&lt;/ref&gt; The university, in its infancy, was established on the ideals of its founder, [[Thomas Jefferson]]. It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco and alcohol, but these rules were generally ignored. Jefferson had enacted a system of student self-government, the [[University_of_Virginia#Honor_System|Honor System]], allowing students to choose their own studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high drop-out rate.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 21&amp;nbsp;– 22&lt;/ref&gt; During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. Poe claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe's debts increased.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 32&amp;nbsp;– 34&lt;/ref&gt; Poe gave up on the university after a year, and, not feeling welcome in Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married Alexander Shelton, he traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer.&lt;ref name=Meyers32&gt;Meyers, 32&lt;/ref&gt; At some point he started using the [[pseudonym]] Henri Le Rennet.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 41&lt;/ref&gt;'''

[[Image:FtIndependence2.jpg|left|thumb|Poe was first stationed at Boston's [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Fort Independence]] while in the army.]]

===Military career===
Unable to support himself, on May 27, 1827, Poe enlisted in the [[United States Army]] as a private. Using the name &quot;Edgar A. Perry&quot;, he claimed he was {{nowrap|22 years old}} even though he was 18.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius, Kay. &quot;Biography of Edgar Allan Poe&quot;, ''Bloom's BioCritiques: Edgar Allan Poe'', Ed. Harold Bloom, Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2002. p. 13 ISBN 0791061736&lt;/ref&gt; He first served at [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Fort Independence]] in [[Boston Harbor]] for five&amp;nbsp;dollars a month.&lt;ref name=Meyers32/&gt; That same year, he released his first book, a 40-page collection of poetry, ''[[Tamerlane and Other Poems]]'', attributed with the byline &quot;by a Bostonian&quot;. Only 50&amp;nbsp;copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 33&amp;nbsp;– 34&lt;/ref&gt; Poe's regiment was posted to [[Fort Moultrie National Monument|Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and traveled by ship on the brig ''Waltham'' on November 8, 1827. Poe was promoted to &quot;artificer&quot;, an enlisted tradesman who prepared shells for [[artillery]], and had his monthly pay doubled.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 35&lt;/ref&gt; After serving for two&amp;nbsp;years and attaining the rank of Sergeant Major for Artillery (the highest rank a noncommissioned officer can achieve), Poe sought to end his five-year enlistment early. He revealed his real name and his circumstances to his [[commanding officer]], Lieutenant Howard. Howard would only allow Poe to be [[military discharge|discharged]] if he reconciled with John Allan and wrote a letter to Allan, who was unsympathetic. Several months passed and pleas to Allan were ignored; Allan may not have written to Poe even to make him aware of his foster mother's illness. Frances Allan died on February 28, 1829, and Poe visited the day after her burial. Perhaps softened by his wife's death, John Allan agreed to support Poe's attempt to be discharged in order to receive an appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 43&amp;nbsp;– 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Poe finally was discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlisted term for him.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 38&lt;/ref&gt; Before entering West Point, Poe moved back to Baltimore for a time, to stay with his widowed aunt Maria Clemm, her daughter, [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Eliza Clemm]] (Poe's first cousin), his brother Henry, and his invalid grandmother Elizabeth Cairnes Poe.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius, Kay. &quot;Biography of Edgar Allan Poe&quot;, ''Bloom's BioCritiques: Edgar Allan Poe'', Ed. Harold Bloom, Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2002. pp. 13&amp;nbsp;– 14 ISBN 0791061736&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Poe published his second book, ''Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems'', in Baltimore in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Poe traveled to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Krutch, 32&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1830, John Allan married his second wife, Louisa Patterson.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius, Kay. &quot;Biography of Edgar Allan Poe&quot;, ''Bloom's BioCritiques: Edgar Allan Poe'', Ed. Harold Bloom, Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2002. p. 14 ISBN 0791061736&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage, and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of affairs, led to the foster father finally disowning Poe.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 54&amp;nbsp;– 55&lt;/ref&gt; Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting [[court-martial]]ed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. Poe tactically pled not guilty to induce dismissal, knowing he would be found guilty.&lt;ref&gt;Hecker, William J. ''Private Perry and Mister Poe: The West Point Poems''. Louisiana State University Press, 2005. pp. 49&amp;nbsp;– 51&lt;/ref&gt;

He left for New York in February 1831, and released a third volume of poems, simply titled ''Poems.'' The book was financed with help from his fellow cadets at West Point, many of whom donated 75&amp;nbsp;cents to the cause, raising a total of $170. They may have been expecting verses similar to the satirical ones Poe had been writing about commanding officers.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 50&amp;nbsp;– 51&lt;/ref&gt; Printed by Elam Bliss of New York, it was labeled as &quot;Second Edition&quot; and included a page saying, &quot;To the U.S. Corps of Cadets this volume is respectfully dedicated.&quot; The book once again reprinted the long poems &quot;Tamerlane&quot; and &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; but also six previously unpublished poems including early versions of &quot;[[To Helen]]&quot;, &quot;[[Poems by Edgar Allan Poe#Israfel (1831)|Israfel]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The City in the Sea]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hecker, William J. ''Private Perry and Mister Poe: The West Point Poems''. Louisiana State University Press, 2005. pp. 53&amp;nbsp;– 54&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Baltimore, to his aunt, brother and cousin, in March 1831. His elder brother Henry, who had been in ill health in part due to problems with alcoholism, died on August 1, 1831.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 187&amp;nbsp;– 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publishing career===
After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest attempts to start his career as a writer. He chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Whalen, 64&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first well-known American to try to live by writing alone&lt;ref name=Meyers138&gt;Meyers, 138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Quinn305&gt;Quinn, 305&lt;/ref&gt; and was hampered by the lack of an international [[copyright]] law.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 247&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers often pirated copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans.&lt;ref name=Quinn305/&gt; The industry was also particularly hurt by the [[Panic of 1837]].&lt;ref&gt;Whalen, 74&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a booming growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, many did not last beyond a few issues&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 99&lt;/ref&gt; and publishers often refused to pay their writers or paid them much later than they promised.&lt;ref&gt;Whalen, 82&lt;/ref&gt; Poe, throughout his attempts at pursuing a successful literary career, would be forced to constantly make humiliating pleas for money and other assistance for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 139&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:VirginiaPoe.jpg|right|thumb|Poe married his 13-year old cousin, [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Clemm]]. Her early death may have inspired some of his writing.]]
After his early attempts at poetry, Poe had turned his attention to prose. He placed a few stories with a [[Philadelphia]] publication and began work on his only drama, ''[[Politian (play)|Politian]]''. The ''Saturday Visitor'', a Baltimore paper, awarded Poe a prize in October 1833 for his short story &quot;[[MS. Found in a Bottle]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, 162&lt;/ref&gt; The story brought him to the attention of [[John P. Kennedy]], a Baltimorian of considerable means. He helped Poe place some of his stories, and introduced him to Thomas W. White, editor of the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]'' in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. Poe became assistant editor of the periodical in August 1835;&lt;ref&gt;Sova, 225&lt;/ref&gt; however, within a few weeks, he was discharged after being found drunk repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 73&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Baltimore, Poe secretly married Virginia, his cousin, on September 22, 1835. She was 13 at the time, though she is listed on the marriage certificate as being 21.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 85&lt;/ref&gt; Reinstated by White after promising good behavior, Poe went back to Richmond with Virginia and her mother. He remained at the ''Messenger'' until January 1837. During this period, its circulation increased from 700 to 3,500.&lt;ref name=&quot;hervey&quot; /&gt; He published several poems, book reviews, criticism, and stories in the paper. On May 16, 1836, he had a second wedding ceremony in Richmond with Virginia Clemm, this time in public.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 124&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket|The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym]]'' was published and widely reviewed in 1838. In the summer of 1839, Poe became assistant editor of ''[[Burton's Gentleman's Magazine]]''. He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing his reputation as a trenchant critic that he had established at the ''Southern Literary Messenger''. Also in 1839, the collection ''[[Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque]]'' was published in two&amp;nbsp;volumes, though he made little money off of it and it received mixed reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 113&lt;/ref&gt; Poe left ''Burton's'' after about a year and found a position as assistant at ''[[Graham's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, 39, 99&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1840, Poe published a prospectus announcing his intentions to start his own journal, ''[[The Stylus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 119&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Poe intended to call the journal ''The Penn'', as it would have been based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In the June 6, 1840 issue of Philadelphia's ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', Poe bought advertising space for his prospectus: ''&quot;Prospectus of the Penn Magazine, a Monthly Literary journal to be edited and published in the city of Philadelphia by Edgar A. Poe.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 159&lt;/ref&gt; The journal would never be produced before Poe's death. Around this time, he attempted to secure a position with the [[John Tyler|Tyler]] administration, claiming he was a member of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 321&amp;nbsp;– 322&lt;/ref&gt; He hoped to be appointed to the [[Custom House]] in Philadelphia with help from President Tyler's son Robert,&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 186&lt;/ref&gt; an acquaintance of Poe's friend Frederick Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 144&lt;/ref&gt; Poe failed to show up for a meeting with Thomas to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to be sick, though Thomas believed he was drunk.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 187&lt;/ref&gt; Though he was promised an appointment, all positions were filled by others.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 188&lt;/ref&gt;

One evening in January 1842, Virginia showed the first signs of consumption, now known as [[tuberculosis]], while singing and playing the piano. Poe described it as breaking a blood vessel in her throat.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 179&lt;/ref&gt; She only partially recovered. Poe began to drink more heavily under the stress of Virginia's illness. He left ''Graham's'' and attempted to find a new position, for a time angling for a government post. He returned to New York, where he worked briefly at the ''Evening Mirror'' before becoming editor of the ''[[Broadway Journal]]'' and, later, sole owner.&lt;ref name=Sova34&gt;Sova, 34&lt;/ref&gt; There he alienated himself from other writers by publicly accusing [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] of [[plagiarism]], though Longfellow never responded.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 455&lt;/ref&gt; On January 29, 1845, his poem &quot;[[The Raven]]&quot; appeared in the ''Evening Mirror'' and became a popular sensation. Though it made Poe a household name almost instantly,&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, 80&lt;/ref&gt; he only was paid $9 for its publication.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrom, John Ward. &quot;Edgar A. Poe: His Income as Literary Entrepreneur&quot;, ''Poe Studies'' 5.1 (1982): 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Poe's house hi res.jpg|thumb|left|Poe spent the last few years of his life in a small cottage in the Bronx, New York.]]The ''Broadway Journal'' failed in 1846.&lt;ref name=Sova34/&gt; Poe moved to [[Edgar Allan Poe Cottage|a cottage]] in the [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]] section of [[The Bronx, New York]]. That home, known today as the &quot;Poe Cottage&quot;, is on the southeast corner of the [[Grand Concourse]] and Kingsbridge Road. Virginia died there on January 30, 1847.&lt;ref name='Poe Cottage'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bronxhistoricalsociety.org/about/poecottage.html |title=Edgar Allan Poe Cottage |accessdate=2007-10-13 |publisher=Bronx Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographers and critics often suggest Poe's frequent theme of the &quot;death of a beautiful woman&quot; stems from the repeated loss of women throughout his life, including his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Weekes, Karen. &quot;Poe's feminine ideal,&quot; ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', Ed. Kevin J. Hayes. Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 149. ISBN 0521797276&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly unstable after his wife's death, Poe attempted to court the poet [[Sarah Helen Whitman]], who lived in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. Their engagement failed, purportedly because of Poe's drinking and erratic behavior. However, there is also strong evidence that Whitman's mother intervened and did much to derail their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Benton, Richard P. &quot;Friends and Enemies: Women in the Life of Edgar Allan Poe&quot;, ''Myths and Reality: The Mysterious Mr. Poe''. Baltimore: Edgar Allan Poe Society, 1987. p. 19 ISBN 0961644915&lt;/ref&gt; Poe then returned to Richmond and resumed a relationship with a childhood sweetheart, Sarah Elmira Royster.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 628&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[Image:Poe's grave Baltimore MD.jpg|thumb|right|Edgar Allan Poe is buried in Baltimore, Maryland. The circumstances and cause of his death remain uncertain.]]
{{main|Death of Edgar Allan Poe}}
On October 3, 1849, Poe was found on the streets of Baltimore delirious, &quot;in great distress, and... in need of immediate assistance&quot;, according to the man who found him, Joseph W. Walker.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 638&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken to the Washington College Hospital, where he died on Sunday, October 7, 1849, at 5:00 in the morning.&lt;ref name=Meyers255&gt;Meyers, 255&lt;/ref&gt; Poe was never coherent long enough to explain how he came to be in his dire condition, and, oddly, was wearing clothes that were not his own. Poe is said to have repeatedly called out the name &quot;Reynolds&quot; on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring. Some sources say Poe's final words were &quot;Lord help my poor soul.&quot;&lt;ref name=Meyers255/&gt; All medical records, including his death certificate, have been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Bramsback, Birgit (1970). &quot;The Final Illness and Death of Edgar Allan Poe: An Attempt at Reassessment&quot;, ''Studia Neophilologica'' (University of Uppsala), XLII. p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers at the time reported Poe's death as &quot;congestion of the brain&quot; or &quot;cerebral inflammation&quot;, common [[euphemism]]s for deaths from disreputable causes such as alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 435&amp;nbsp;– 436&lt;/ref&gt; However, the actual cause of death remains a mystery;&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 435&lt;/ref&gt; from as early as 1872, [[cooping]] was commonly believed to have been the cause,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Midnight Dreary: The Mysterious Death of Edgar Allan Poe |last=Walsh |first=John Evangelist |publisher=St. Martin's Minotaur |location=New York |edition=Paperback ed. |pages=32&amp;nbsp;– 33 |year=2000 |id=ISBN 0312227329}}&lt;/ref&gt; and speculation has included ''[[delirium tremens]]'', [[heart disease]], [[epilepsy]], [[syphilis]], [[meningitis|meningeal inflammation]],&lt;ref name=Meyers256&gt;Meyers, 256&lt;/ref&gt; [[cholera]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Griswold's &quot;Memoir&quot;===
The day Edgar Allan Poe was buried, a long obituary appeared in the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' signed &quot;Ludwig&quot;. It was soon published throughout the country. The piece began, &quot;Edgar Allan Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore the day before yesterday. This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved by it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 259. To read Griswold's full obituary, see [[wikisource:Death of Edgar Allan Poe|Edgar Allan Poe obituary]] at Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Ludwig&quot; was soon identified as [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]], an editor, critic and anthologist who had borne a grudge against Poe since 1842. Griswold somehow became Poe's [[literary executor]] and attempted to destroy his enemy's reputation after his death.&lt;ref name=Hoffman14&gt;Hoffman, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Rufus Griswold wrote a biographical article of Poe called &quot;Memoir of the Author&quot;, which he included in an 1850 volume of the collected works. Griswold depicted Poe as a depraved, drunk, drug-addled madman and included Poe's letters as evidence.&lt;ref name=Hoffman14/&gt; Many of his claims were either outright lies or distorted half-truths. For example, it is now known that Poe was not a drug addict.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 693&lt;/ref&gt; Griswold's book was denounced by those who knew Poe well,&lt;ref&gt;Sova, 101&lt;/ref&gt; but it became a popularly accepted one. This occurred in part because it was the only full biography available and was widely reprinted and in part because readers thrilled at the thought of reading works by an &quot;evil&quot; man.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 263&lt;/ref&gt; Letters that Griswold presented as proof of this depiction of Poe were later revealed as [[forgery|forgeries]].&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 699&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary style and themes==
[[Image:Edgar Allan Poe portrait B.jpg|right|thumb|200px|1860s portrait by Oscar Halling after an 1849 daguerreotype]]
===Genres===
Poe's best known fiction works are [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]],&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 64&lt;/ref&gt; a genre he followed to appease the public taste.&lt;ref name=Royot57&gt;Royot, Daniel (2002). &quot;Poe's Humor&quot;, ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe''. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0521797276. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of [[premature burial]], the reanimation of the dead, and [[mourning]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, J. Gerald (1987). ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press. ISBN 0300037732. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his works are generally considered part of the [[dark romanticism]] genre, a literary reaction to [[transcendentalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Koster, Donald N. (2002). &quot;Influences of Transcendentalism on American Life and Literature&quot;, ''Literary Movements for Students Vol. 1''. David Galens, ed. Detroit: Thompson Gale. p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; which Poe strongly disliked.&lt;ref&gt;Ljunquist, Kent (2002). &quot;The poet as critic&quot;, ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', Kevin J. Hayes, ed. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0521797276 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; He referred to followers of the movement as &quot;Frogpondians&quot; after the pond on [[Boston Common (park)|Boston Common]].&lt;ref&gt;Royot, Daniel. &quot;Poe's humor,&quot; as collected in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', Kevin J. Hayes, ed. Cambridge University Press, 2002. pp. 61&amp;nbsp;– 62. ISBN 0521797276&lt;/ref&gt; and ridiculed their writings as &quot;[[metaphor]]-run&quot;, lapsing into &quot;obscurity for obscurity's sake&quot; or &quot;mysticism for mysticism's sake.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ljunquist, Kent. &quot;The poet as critic&quot; collected in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', Kevin J. Hayes, ed. Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 15. ISBN 0521797276&lt;/ref&gt; Poe once wrote in a letter to [[Thomas Holley Chivers]] that he did not dislike Transcendentalists, &quot;only the pretenders and [[sophism|sophists]] among them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond horror, Poe also wrote [[satire]]s, humor tales, and [[hoax]]es. For comic effect, he used irony and ludicrous extravagance, often in an attempt to liberate the reader from cultural conformity.&lt;ref name=Royot57/&gt; In fact, &quot;[[Metzengerstein]]&quot;, the first story that Poe is known to have published,&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 88&lt;/ref&gt; and his first foray into horror, was originally intended as a [[burlesque (genre)|burlesque]] satirizing the popular genre.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Benjamin Franklin (1993). &quot;Poe's 'Metzengerstein': Not a Hoax&quot;, ''On Poe: The Best from &quot;American Literature.'' Durham, NC: Duke University Press. p. 142, 149&lt;/ref&gt; Poe also reinvented [[science fiction]], responding in his writing to emerging technologies such as [[hot air balloon]]s in &quot;[[The Balloon-Hoax]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tresch, John (2002). &quot;Extra! Extra! Poe invents science fiction!&quot;, ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', Kevin J. Hayes, ed. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0521797276. p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poe wrote much of his work using themes specifically catered for mass market tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Whalen, 67&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, his fiction often included elements of popular [[pseudoscience]]s such as [[phrenology]]&lt;ref&gt;Edward Hungerford (1930). &quot;Poe and Phrenology&quot;, ''American Literature'' Vol. 1. p. 209&amp;nbsp;– 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[physiognomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Erik Grayson (2005). &quot;Weird Science, Weirder Unity: Phrenology and Physiognomy in Edgar Allan Poe&quot;, ''Mode'' Vol. 1 p. 56&amp;nbsp;– 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary theory===
Poe's writing reflects his literary theories, which he presented in his criticism and also in essays such as &quot;[[The Poetic Principle]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Krutch225&gt;Krutch, 225&lt;/ref&gt; He disliked [[didacticism]]&lt;ref name=Kagle104&gt;Kagle, Steven E. &quot;The Corpse Within Us&quot;, ''Poe and His Times: The Artist and His Milieu'', Ed. Benjamin Franklin Fisher IV. Baltimore: The Edgar Allan Poe Society, Inc., 1990. ISBN 0961644923. p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and [[allegory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eapoe.org/works/CRITICSM/GLB47HN1.HTM|title=Tale-Writing&amp;nbsp;— Nathaniel Hawthorne |last=Poe|first=Edgar A. |publisher=''Godey's Lady's Book'', November 1847, pp. 252&amp;nbsp;– 256|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he believed that meaning in literature should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface. Works with obvious meanings, he wrote, cease to be art.&lt;ref name=Wilbur99&gt;Wilbur, Richard (1967). &quot;The House of Poe&quot;, ''Poe: A Collection of Critical Essays'', Ed. Robert Regan. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc. p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that quality work should be brief and focus on a specific single effect.&lt;ref name=Krutch225/&gt; To that end, he believed that the writer should carefully calculate every sentiment and idea.&lt;ref&gt;Jannaccone, Pasquale (translated by Peter Mitilineos) (1974). &quot;[http://www.eapoe.org/pstudies/ps1970/p1974101.htm The Aesthetics of Edgar Poe]&quot;, ''Poe Studies'' Vol. 7.1. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[The Philosophy of Composition]]&quot;, an essay in which Poe describes his method in writing &quot;The Raven&quot;, he claims to have strictly followed this method. It has been questioned, however, if he really followed this system. [[T. S. Eliot]] said: &quot;It is difficult for us to read that essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, 76&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Joseph Wood Krutch described the essay as &quot;a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Krutch, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===Literary influence===
During his lifetime, Poe was mostly recognized as a literary critic. Fellow critic [[James Russell Lowell]] called him &quot;the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in America&quot;, though he questioned if he occasionally used [[hydrogen cyanide|prussic acid]] instead of ink.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 432&lt;/ref&gt; Poe was also known as a writer of fiction and became one of the first American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 258&lt;/ref&gt; Poe is particularly respected in France, in part due to early translations by [[Charles Baudelaire]]. Baudelaire's translations became definitive renditions of Poe's work throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Harner, Gary Wayne. &quot;Edgar Allan Poe in France: Baudelaire's Labor of Love&quot;, ''Poe and His Times: The Artist and His Milieu'', Ed. Benjamin Franklin Fisher IV. Baltimore: The Edgar Allan Poe Society, 1990. p. 218. ISBN 0961644923&lt;/ref&gt;

Poe's early [[detective fiction]] tales starring the fictitious [[C. Auguste Dupin]] laid the groundwork for future detectives in literature. Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] said, &quot;Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed.... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Poe Encyclopedia'', 103&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mystery Writers of America]] have named their awards for excellence in the genre the &quot;[[Edgar Award|Edgars]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Neimeyer, Mark. &quot;Poe and Popular Culture,&quot; Ed. Kevin J. Hayes. ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe''. Cambridge University Press, 2002. ISBN 0521797276 p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Poe's work also influenced [[science fiction]], notably [[Jules Verne]], who wrote a sequel to Poe's novel ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]'' called ''The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, Le sphinx des glaces''.&lt;ref&gt;''Poe Encyclopedia'', 364&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction author [[H. G. Wells]] noted, &quot;''Pym'' tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Poe Encyclopedia'', 372&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many famous artists, Poe's works have spawned innumerable imitators.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 281&lt;/ref&gt; One interesting trend among imitators of Poe, however, has been claims by [[clairvoyance|clairvoyants]] or [[psychics]] to be &quot;channeling&quot; poems from Poe's spirit. One of the most notable of these was Lizzie Doten, who in 1863 published ''Poems from the Inner Life'', in which she claimed to have &quot;received&quot; new compositions by Poe's spirit. The compositions were re-workings of famous Poe poems such as &quot;[[The Bells]]&quot;, but which reflected a new, positive outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Carlson |first = Eric Walter |title = A Companion to Poe Studies |publisher = Greenwood Press |year= 1996 |location = Westport, Connecticut |pages = 476 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=nMHFGbxYhEMC&amp;pg=PA476&amp;lpg=PA476&amp;dq=%22lizzie+doten%22+poe&amp;source=web&amp;ots=73YdR-r7Gy&amp;sig=gnW0O_qhywhhUTnIGKkZk0dIup0 |isbn = 0-313-26506-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even so, Poe has not received only praise. [[William Butler Yeats]] was generally critical of Poe and denounced him as &quot;vulgar&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 274&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] reacted to &quot;The Raven&quot; by saying, &quot;I see nothing in it&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 265&lt;/ref&gt; and derisively referred to Poe as &quot;the jingle man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A03E5D91630E033A25753C2A9639C94659ED7CF|title=Emerson's Estimate of Poe|accessdate=2008-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aldous Huxley]] wrote that Poe's writing &quot;falls into vulgarity&quot; by being &quot;too poetical&quot; - the equivalent of wearing a diamond ring on every finger.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous. &quot;Vulgarity in Literature,&quot; ''Poe: A Collection of Critical Essays'', Ed. Robert Regan, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall Inc., 1967. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physics and cosmology===
''[[Eureka: A Prose Poem]]'', an essay written in 1848, included a cosmological theory that presaged the [[big bang]] theory by 80 years,&lt;ref&gt;Rombeck, Terry. &quot;[http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/jan/22/poes_littleknown_science/ Poe's little-known science book reprinted]&quot;, ''Lawrence Journal-World &amp; News''. January 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the first plausible solution to [[Olbers' paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Smoot|Smoot, George]] and Keay Davidson. ''Wrinkles in Time''. Harper Perennial, Reprint edition (October 1, 1994) ISBN 0-380-72044-2&lt;/ref&gt; Poe eschewed the scientific method in ''Eureka'' and instead wrote from pure [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].&lt;ref name=Meyers214&gt;Meyers, 214&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, he considered it a work of art, not science,&lt;ref name=Meyers214/&gt; but insisted that it was still true&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 399&lt;/ref&gt; and considered it to be his career masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 219&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, ''Eureka'' is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions opposed [[Newton's laws of motion|Newtonian principles]] regarding the density and rotation of planets.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, 82&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryptography===
Poe had a keen interest in the field of [[cryptography]]. He had placed a notice of his abilities in the [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] paper ''Alexander's Weekly (Express) Messenger'', inviting submissions of [[cipher]]s, which he proceeded to solve.&lt;ref name=Silverman152&gt;Silverman, 152&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1841, Poe had published an essay called &quot;A Few Words on Secret Writing&quot; in ''[[Graham's Magazine]]''. Realizing the public interest in the topic, he wrote &quot;[[The Gold-Bug]]&quot; incorporating ciphers as part of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenheim, 2, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Poe's success in cryptography relied not so much on his knowledge of that field (his method was limited to the simple substitution cryptogram), as on his knowledge of the magazine and newspaper culture. His keen analytical abilities, which were so evident in his detective stories, allowed him to see that the general public was largely ignorant of the methods by which a simple substitution cryptogram can be solved, and he used this to his advantage.&lt;ref name=Silverman152/&gt; The sensation Poe created with his cryptography stunt played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, William F. &quot;Edgar Allan Poe, Cryptographer&quot;, ''On Poe: The Best from &quot;American Literature&quot;''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1993. p. 40&amp;nbsp;– 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Poe had an influence on cryptography beyond increasing public interest in his lifetime. [[William Friedman]], America's foremost cryptologist, was heavily influenced by Poe.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenheim, 15&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman's initial interest in cryptography came from reading &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; as a child&amp;nbsp;— interest he later put to use in deciphering Japan's [[PURPLE]] code during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenheim, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poe in popular culture==
===Poe as a character===
{{main|Edgar Allan Poe in popular culture|Edgar Allan Poe in television and film}}
The historical Edgar Allan Poe has appeared as a fictionalized character, often representing the &quot;mad genius&quot; or &quot;tormented artist&quot; and exploiting his personal struggles.&lt;ref&gt;Neimeyer, Mark. &quot;Poe and Popular Culture&quot;, ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe''. Cambridge University Press, 2002. ISBN 0521797276 p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Many such depictions also blend in with characters from his stories, suggesting Poe and his characters share identities.&lt;ref&gt;Gargano, James W. &quot;The Question of Poe's Narrators,&quot; ''Poe: A Collection of Critical Essays'', Ed. Robert Regan. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1967. p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Often, fictional depictions of Poe use his mystery-solving skills in such novels as ''[[The Poe Shadow]]'' by [[Matthew Pearl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Janet |last=Maslin |coauthors= |title=The Poe Shadow |date=[[2006-06-06]] |publisher= |url =http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/06/06/features/bookwed.php |work =International Herald Tribune |pages = |accessdate = 2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PoeNHS.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site]] in Philadelphia is one of several preserved former residences of Poe.]]
===Preserved homes, landmarks, and museums===
No childhood home of Poe is still standing, including the Allan family's Moldavia estate. The oldest standing home in Richmond, the Old Stone House, is in use as the [[Edgar Allan Poe Museum (Richmond)|Edgar Allan Poe Museum]], though Poe never lived there. The collection includes many items Poe used during his time with the Allan family and also features several rare first printings of Poe works. The dorm room Poe is believed to have used while studying at the University of Virginia in 1826 is preserved and available for visits. Its upkeep is now overseen by a group of students and staff known as the [[Raven Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uvaravensociety.com/ Raven Society Homepage]. [[University of Virginia]]. Retrieved on December 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving home in which Poe lived is in Baltimore, preserved as the [[Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum]]. Poe is believed to have lived in the home at the age of 23 when he first lived with Maria Clemm and Virginia (as well as his grandmother and possibly his brother William Henry Leonard Poe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eapoe.org/balt/poehse.htm |title=The Baltimore Poe House and Museum |accessdate=2007-10-13 |publisher=Edgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is open to the public and is also the home of the Edgar Allan Poe Society. Of the several homes that Poe, his wife Virginia, and his mother-in-law Maria rented in Philadelphia, only the last house has survived. The Spring Garden home, where the author lived in 1843–1844, is today preserved by the [[National Park Service]] as the [[Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Niccole |last=Burns |title=Poe wrote most important works in Philadelphia |date=[[2006-11-15]] |publisher=School of Communication&amp;nbsp;— University of Miami |url =http://com.miami.edu/parks/philapoeauthor.htm |work = |accessdate = 2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe's final home is preserved as the [[Edgar Allan Poe Cottage]] in the Bronx, New York.&lt;ref name='Poe Cottage'/&gt;

Other Poe landmarks include a building in the [[Upper West Side]], where Poe temporarily lived when he first moved to New York. A plaque suggests that Poe wrote &quot;The Raven&quot; here. In Boston, a plaque hangs near the building where Poe was born once stood. Believed to have been located at 62 Carver Street (now Charles Street), the plaque is possibly in an incorrect location.&lt;ref&gt;Van Hoy, David C.

===Poe Toaster===
{{main|Poe Toaster}}
Adding to the mystery surrounding Poe's death, an unknown visitor affectionately referred to as the &quot;Poe Toaster&quot; has paid homage to Poe's grave every year since 1949. As the tradition has been carried on for more than 50&amp;nbsp;years, it is likely that the &quot;Poe Toaster&quot; is actually several individuals; however, the tribute is always the same. Every January 19, in the early hours of the morning, the man makes a toast of [[Cognac (drink)|cognac]] to Poe's original grave marker and leaves three roses. Members of the Edgar Allan Poe Society in Baltimore have helped in protecting this tradition for decades. On August 15, 2007, Sam Porpora, a former historian at the Westminster Church in Baltimore where Poe is buried, claimed that he had started the tradition in the 1960s. The claim that the tradition began in 1949, he said, was a hoax in order to raise money and enhance the profile of the church. His story has not been confirmed,&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Wiley. &quot;[http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=2007-08-15_D8R1O6LO0&amp;show_article=1&amp;cat=breaking Poe Fan Takes Credit for Grave Legend],&quot; Associated Press, August 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and some details he has given to the press have been pointed out as factually inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Associated Press |title = Man Reveals Legend of Mystery Visitor to Edgar Allan Poe's Grave |publisher = FoxNews.com |date = August 15, 2007 |url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,293413,00.html |accessdate = 2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Desi Arnaz''' (born '''Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha III''') ([[March 2]], [[1917]] – [[December 2]], [[1986]]) was a [[Cuban American]] [[musician]], [[actor]] and [[television producer]].

&lt;!--spacing, please do not remove--&gt;

==Early life==
Desi Arnaz was born on [[March 2]], [[1917]] in [[Santiago de Cuba]], Cuba to Desiderio Alberto Arnaz (1894-1973) and Dolores de Acha (1896-1988). His father was Santiago's youngest mayor and then served in the Cuban House of Representatives. The 1933 revolution, led by [[Fulgencio Batista]], overthrew the [[United States|American]]-backed President [[Gerardo Machado]], landed his father in jail for six months, and stripped his family of its wealth and power. Arnaz's father was released when U.S. officials, who believed him to be neutral during the revolt, intervened on his behalf. Arnaz and his parents then fled to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]].
;;;;;;

==Film career==
In 1939, he starred on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the successful [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Too Many Girls (musical)|Too Many Girls]]''. He then went to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] to appear in the [[1940 in film|1940]] [[film|movie]] version at [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], which starred actress, comedienne, and his future wife [[Lucille Ball]]. At the time, he also played guitar for [[Xavier Cugat]] &lt;ref&gt; A Book; Arnaz, Desi &lt;/ref&gt;

Arnaz appeared in several movies in the 1940s, most notably ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]'' ([[1943 in film|1943]]). Shortly after he received his [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] notice, but before he was actually inducted, he injured his knee. Although he made it through [[boot camp]], he was eventually classified for limited service, and ended up directing [[United Service Organization]] (U.S.O.) programs at a military hospital in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. In his memoirs, he recalled discovering that the first thing soldiers requested was almost invariably a glass of cold milk, so he arranged for beautiful starlets to greet the wounded soldiers as they disembarked and pour milk for them. After leaving the Army, he formed another orchestra, which was successful in live appearances and recordings. After he became engaged in television, he kept the orchestra on his payroll throughout the period he remained an active producer.

===''I Love Lucy''=== 
On October 15, 1951, Desi produced and starred in ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' in which he played a fictitious version of himself, Cuban orchestra leader Enrique &quot;Ricky&quot; Ricardo. His co-star was his real-life wife, [[Lucille Ball]], who played Ricky's wife, Lucy. Television executives had been pursuing Ball to adapt her very popular radio series ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'' for television. Ball insisted on Arnaz playing her on-air spouse so the two would be able to spend more time together. The original premise was for the couple to portray Lucy and Larry Lopez, a successful [[show business]] couple (he a band leader, she an actress) whose glamorous careers interfered with their efforts to maintain a normal marriage. Market research indicated, however, that this scenario would not be popular, so Arnaz changed it to make Ricky a struggling young orchestra leader and Lucy an ordinary housewife who had show business fantasies but no talent. Desi would often appear at, and later own, the Tropicana Club which, under his ownership, he renamed Club Babalu. Initially, the idea of having Ball and the distinctly Latino Arnaz portray a married couple encountered resistance as they were told that Desi's Cuban accent and Latin style would not be agreeable to American viewers. The couple overcame these objections, however, by touring together in a live [[vaudeville]] act they developed with the help of Spanish clown Pepito Pérez, together with Ball's radio show writers. Much of the material from their vaudeville act was used in the original &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; pilot, including Lucy's memorable seal routine. (The pilot originally ran as the sixth episode of the show's first season.)

===Desilu Productions===
With Ball, he founded [[Desilu Productions]]. At this time, most [[television program]]s were broadcast live and, as the largest markets were in New York, the rest of the country received only [[kinescope]] images. [[Karl Freund]], Arnaz's cameraman, developed the [[multiple-camera setup]] production style using adjacent sets that became the standard for all subsequent [[situation comedy|situation comedies]] to this day. The use of film enabled every station around the country to broadcast high-quality images of the show. Arnaz was told that it would be impossible to allow an audience onto a sound stage, but he worked with Freund to design a set that would accommodate an audience, allow filming, and also adhere to fire and safety codes.

[[Television network|Network]] executives considered the use of film an unnecessary extravagance. Arnaz convinced them to allow Desilu to cover all additional costs associated with the filming process, under the stipulation that Desilu owned and controlled all rights to the film. Arnaz's unprecedented arrangement is widely considered to be one of the shrewdest deals in television history. As a result of his foresight, Desilu reaped the profits from all reruns of the series.

Arnaz also pushed the network to allow them to show Lucille Ball while she was [[Pregnancy|pregnant]]. According to Arnaz, the [[CBS]] network told him, &quot;You cannot show a pregnant woman on television.&quot; Arnaz consulted a [[priest]], a [[rabbi]], and a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], all of whom told him that there would be nothing wrong with showing a pregnant Lucy or with using the word ''pregnant''. The network finally relented and let Arnaz and Ball weave the pregnancy into the story line, but remained adamant about eschewing use of ''pregnant'', so Arnaz substituted ''expecting'', pronouncing it '' 'spectin' '' in his Cuban accent. Oddly, the official title of the episode announcing the pregnancy was &quot;Lucy Is Enceinte,&quot; employing the [[French language|French]] word for pregnant.

In addition to ''I Love Lucy'', he produced ''[[December Bride]]'', ''[[The Mothers-in-Law]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Those Whiting Girls]]'', ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'', ''[[The Danny Thomas Show]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', and ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Star Trek TOS]]'' all Top shows in their time, and the 1956 [[feature film]] ''[[Forever, Darling]]'', in which he and Ball starred. His foresight in filming and retaining post-broadcast ownership of shows had a huge impact on the future of television syndication ([[rerun]]s).

==Beliefs==
Arnaz and Ball avoided [[ethnic joke]]s. Arnaz recalled that the only exception consisted of making fun of Ricky Ricardo's accent, and noted that even these jokes worked only when Lucy, as his wife, did the mimicking.

Arnaz was  patriotic; in his memoirs, the first object of thanks is the [[United States]] itself: &quot;I know of no other country in the world&quot;, he wrote, in which &quot;a sixteen-year-old kid, broke and unable to speak the language&quot; could reach the success he had. Over the show's six-year run, the fortunes of the Ricardos mirror that of the archetypal 1950s [[American Dream]]: At first, they live in a tiny [[brownstone]] apartment; Ricky's fortunes continue to improve, and they move into a slightly larger one with a view after Little Ricky is born. Later, Ricky gets his big break and goes to [[Hollywood]]; shortly after returning to New York, all of them have the chance to travel through [[Europe]]. Finally, Lucy and Ricky head for a house in the wealthy [[Connecticut]] country.

==Marriages==
Arnaz married [[Lucille Ball]] on [[November 30]], [[1940]], and she initiated divorce proceedings in 1944, but returned to him before the [[interlocutory]] decree became final. He and Ball are the parents of actress [[Lucie Arnaz]] (born 1951) and actor [[Desi Arnaz, Jr.]] (born 1953).

Arnaz's marriage with Ball began to collapse under the strain of his serious problems with alcohol, drugs, and womanizing. According to his memoir, the combined pressures of managing the production company as well as supervising its day-to-day operations had greatly worsened as it grew much larger. Arnaz was also suffering from [[diverticulitis]]. He and Ball divorced in 1960; she was 48 and he was 43. When Ball returned to weekly television, she and Arnaz worked out an agreement regarding Desilu, wherein she bought him out.

Arnaz married his second wife, Edith Mack Hirsch, on [[March 2]], [[1963]], and greatly reduced his show business activities. He served as executive producer of ''[[The Mothers-in-Law]]'', and during its two-year run, made four guest appearances as a Spanish [[Torero (bullfighter)|matador]], Señor Delgado. He was widowed in 1985, when his wife Edith died.

Although Arnaz remarried after his divorce from Ball in 1960, they remained friends. Family home movies later aired on television showed Ball and Arnaz playing together with their grandson, Simon (or ''&quot;Simón&quot;'', if Arnaz's mock protests are to be believed), shortly before Arnaz's death.

==Later life==
In the 1970s, Arnaz co-hosted a week of shows with daytime TV host/producer [[Mike Douglas]]. [[Vivian Vance]] appeared as a guest. Arnaz also headlined a ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'' special on [[NBC]] that featured his two children, with a brief appearance by Vance. To promote his autobiography, ''[[A Book]]'', Arnaz, on February 21, 1976, served as a guest host on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', with his son, Desi, Jr., also appearing. The program contained spoofs of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' and ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]''. He also read [[Lewis Carroll]]'s poem &quot;[[Jabberwocky]]&quot; in a heavy Cuban accent (he pronounced it &quot;Habberwocky&quot;). Arnaz, Jr. played the drums and, supported by the ''SNL'' band, Desi sang both &quot;[[Babalu (song)|Babalu]]&quot; and another favorite from his dance band days, &quot;[[Cuban Pete]]&quot;; the arrangements similar to the ones used on ''I Love Lucy''. He ended the broadcast by leading the entire cast in a raucous conga line through the ''SNL'' studio.

Arnaz and his wife eventually moved to [[Del Mar, California]], where he lived the rest of his life in semi-retirement. He owned a 45-acre (18&amp;nbsp;ha) [[horse breeding]] [[farm]] in [[Corona, California]], and raced [[thoroughbred]]s. He contributed to [[Charitable organization|charitable]] and [[non-profit organization]]s, including [[San Diego State University]]. Arnaz would make a guest appearance on the TV series ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', starring [[Linda Lavin]] and produced by ''I Love Lucy'' co-creators [[Madelyn Pugh]] (Madelyn Davis) and [[Bob Carroll, Jr.]]

==Death==
Arnaz, a lifelong smoker, was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] in early 1986. He died several months later on [[December 2]], [[1986]], at age 69. Two days earlier, on what would have been his and Lucille's 46th wedding  anniversary (November 30), she telephoned him. They shared a few words, mostly &quot;I love you's.&quot; She said &quot;All right, honey. I'll talk to you later.&quot; She was, in fact, the last person to ever speak with Desi Arnaz.&lt;ref&gt; Desilu: The Story of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.&lt;/ref&gt; His death came just five days before Lucille Ball received the [[Kennedy Center Honors]].

Desi was survived by his mother, Dolores, who died in 1988 at the age of 94.&lt;ref&gt; http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Desi Arnaz has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]: one at 6327 Hollywood Boulevard for contributions to motion pictures, and one at 6220 Hollywood Boulevard for television.  There is a [[Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Center]] museum in [[Jamestown, New York]] (birthplace of [[Lucille Ball]]) and a Desi Arnaz Bandshell in Lucille Ball Memorial Park in [[Celoron, New York]] (childhood home of Lucille Ball).

Retrieved [[2007-10-22]].&lt;/ref&gt; (January 8, 1935 &amp;ndash; August 16, 1977; middle name sometimes written '''Aron'''){{fn|a}} was an American singer, [[musician]] and actor. A [[cultural icon]], he is commonly referred to by his first name, and as the &quot;[[King of Rock and Roll|The King of Rock 'n' Roll]]&quot; or &quot;The King&quot;.

In 1954, Presley began his career as one of the first performers of [[rockabilly]], an [[uptempo]] fusion of [[country music|country]] and [[rhythm and blues]] with a strong [[back beat]]. His novel versions of existing songs, mixing &quot;[[black people|black]]&quot; and &quot;[[White (people)|white]]&quot; sounds, made him popular&amp;mdash;and controversial&amp;mdash;as did his uninhibited stage and television performances. He recorded songs in the [[rock and roll]] genre, with tracks like &quot;[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]&quot; and &quot;[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]&quot; later embodying the style. Presley had a versatile voice&lt;ref name=Wikiquote&gt;[[q:Elvis Presley|WikiQuote: Elvis Presley]]&lt;/ref&gt; and had unusually wide success encompassing other genres, including [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[blues]], [[ballad]]s and [[Pop music|pop]]. To date, he has been inducted into four music [[Hall of Fame|halls of fame]].

In the 1960s, Presley made the majority of his thirty-one movies&amp;mdash;mainly poorly reviewed, but financially successful, musicals. In 1968, he returned with acclaim to live music in a [[television special]], and thereafter performed across the U.S., notably in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. Throughout his career, he set records for concert attendance, television ratings and recordings sales. He is one of the best-selling and most influential artists in the history of popular music. Health problems, [[drug dependency]] and other factors led to his premature [[death]] at age 42.

His mother, Gladys Love Smith (April 25, 1912 &amp;ndash; August 14, 1958) worked as a [[sewing machine|sewing machinist]]. They met in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], and eloped to [[Pontotoc County, Mississippi|Pontotoc County]] where they married on June 17, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elvispresleynews.com/ScottishElvis.html Elvis Presley's Family Tree].

Presley was born in a two-room [[shotgun house]], built by his father, in East Tupelo. He was an [[identical twin]]&amp;mdash;his brother was [[stillbirth|stillborn]] and given the name Jesse Garon. Growing up as an [[only child]] he &quot;was, everyone agreed, unusually close to his mother.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guralnick-13&quot;&gt;Guralnick 1994, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived just above the poverty line and attended an [[Assembly of God]] church.&lt;ref name=Guralnick-1994-29&gt;Guralnick 1994, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Vernon has been described as &quot;a [[malingerer]], always averse to work and responsibility.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; His wife was &quot;voluble, lively, full of spunk&quot; and had a fondness for drink.&lt;ref name = &quot;Guralnick-12&quot;/&gt; In 1938, Vernon was jailed for an eight dollar check forgery.

In September 1942, Presley entered first grade at Lawhorn School in Tupelo.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot; /&gt; Presley was sometimes bullied; classmates threw &quot;things at him&amp;mdash;rotten fruit and stuff&amp;mdash;because he was different... he stuttered and he was a mama's boy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick 1994, p.36&lt;br /&gt;Referring to an account by singer [[Barbara Pittman]] in Humphries, Patrick (April 1, 2003). &quot;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0740738038 Elvis The #1 Hits: The Secret History of the Classics]&quot; Andrews McMeel Publishing, p.117. [[Special:Booksources/0740738038|ISBN 0740738038]].&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, he was considered a &quot;well-mannered and quiet child&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot; /&gt;

On October 3, 1945, at age ten, he made his first public performance in a singing contest at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show at the suggestion of his teacher Mrs. J.C. Grimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot; /&gt; Dressed as a cowboy, the young Presley had to stand on a chair to reach the microphone and sang [[Red Foley]]'s &quot;Old Shep.&quot; He came second, winning $5 and a free ticket to all the Fair rides.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Elvis Australia'' (Jan 7, 2004). &quot;[http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/biography/elvis_presley_biography_1935_1954.shtml Elvis Presley 1935-54].&quot; ''elvis.com.au''.

Presley practiced playing guitar in the laundry room and also played in a five-piece band with other tenants.&lt;ref name=Guralnick-50/&gt; Another resident, [[Johnny Burnette]], recalled, &quot;Wherever Elvis went he'd have his guitar slung across his back... [H]e'd go in to one of the cafes or bars... Then some folks would say: 'Let's hear you sing, boy.'&quot;&lt;ref name=Carr-10&gt;Carr and Farren, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Presley enrolled at L. C. [[Humes High School]] where some fellow students viewed his performing unfavorably; one recalled that he was &quot;a sad, shy, not especially attractive boy&quot; whose guitar playing was not likely to win any prizes. Presley was made fun of as a 'trashy' kind of boy, playing 'trashy' hillbilly music.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick, ''Last Train to Memphis'', chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Other children however, &quot;would beg him&quot; to sing, but he was apparently too shy to perform.&lt;ref name=Hopkins-33&gt;Hopkins 2007, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1950, Presley occasionally worked evenings as an usher at Loew's State Theater&amp;mdash;his first job&amp;mdash;to boost the family income,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;&gt;Stanley and Coffey, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lichter, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; but his mother made him quit as she feared it was affecting his school work. He worked again at Loew's in June the following year, but was fired after a fistfight over a female employee.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot; /&gt; He began to grow his sideburns and, when he could afford to, dress in the wild, flashy clothes of Lansky Brothers on [[Beale Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Lichter, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; He stood out, especially in the conservative [[Deep South]] of the 1950s, and was mocked and bullied for it.&lt;ref name=Guralnick-50&gt;Guralnick 1994, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; Childhood friend [[Red West]] said: &quot;In the sea of 1600 pink-scalped kids at school, Elvis stood out like a camel in the arctic. ... [but] ... his appearance expressed a defiance which his demeanor did not match...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthew-Walker-5&quot;&gt;Matthew-Walker 1979, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Despite any unpopularity or shyness, he was a contestant in his school's 1952 &quot;Annual Minstrel Show&quot;&lt;ref name=Guralnick-50 /&gt; and won by receiving the most applause. His prize was to sing encores, including &quot;Cold Cold Icy Fingers&quot; and &quot;Till I Waltz Again With You&quot;.&lt;ref name=Carr-10 /&gt;

After graduation, Presley was still rather shy, a &quot;kid who had spent scarcely a night away from home&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick 1994, p.149&lt;/ref&gt; His third job was driving a truck for the Crown Electric Company. He began wearing his hair longer with a &quot;ducktail&quot;&amp;mdash;the style of truck drivers at that time.&lt;ref&gt;(1996). &quot;[http://www.history-of-rock.com/elvis_presley.htm Elvis Presley]&quot;.

===Early musical influences===
Initial influences came through his family's attendance at the [[Assembly of God]], a [[Pentecostal]] [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guralnick-13&quot;/&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote: &quot;Gospel pervaded Elvis' character and was a defining and enduring influence all of his days.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RS&quot;&gt;George-Warren, Holly; Patricia Romanowski, Jon Pareles (2001).

Excerpt in &quot;[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/elvispresley/biography Elvis Presley biography]&quot;. ''Rolling Stone''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-14]].&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life&amp;mdash;in the recording studio, in private, or after concerts&amp;mdash;Presley joined with others singing and playing [[gospel music]] at informal sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick 1994, p.461&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The young Presley frequently listened to local radio; his first musical hero was family friend [[Mississippi Slim]], a [[hillbilly]] singer with a radio show on Tupelo’s [[WELO]]. Presley performed occasionally on Slim’s Saturday morning show, ''Singin’ and Pickin’ Hillbilly''. &quot;He was crazy about music... That’s all he talked about,&quot; recalls his sixth grade friend, James Ausborn, Slim’s younger brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated7&quot;&gt;Guralnick 1994, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; Before he was a teenager, music was already Presley’s &quot;consuming passion&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated7&quot; /&gt; J. R. Snow, son of 1940s country superstar [[Hank Snow]], recalls that even as a young man Presley knew all of Hank Snow’s songs, &quot;even the most obscure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick 1994, p.171&lt;/ref&gt; Presley himself said: &quot;I loved records by [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe|Sister Rosetta Thorpe]], ... Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubbs, [[Ted Daffan]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], Jimmy Davis and [[Bob Wills]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew-Walker 1979, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

In Memphis, Presley went to record stores that had [[jukebox]]es and listening booths, playing old records and new releases for hours. He was an audience member at the all-night white&amp;mdash;and black&amp;mdash;&quot;gospel sings&quot; downtown.&lt;ref name=GoodRockin-54&gt;(August 18, 1997). &quot;Good Rockin'&quot;.

Memphis had a strong tradition of blues music and Presley went to blues as well as hillbilly venues. Many of his future recordings were inspired by local [[African American]] composers and recording artists, including [[Arthur Crudup]], [[Rufus Thomas]] and [[B.B. King]].&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick, Peter (August 11, 2007). &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/11/opinion/11guralnick.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin How Did Elvis Get Turned Into a Racist?]&quot; ''[[New York Times]]''.

He used to come around and be around us a lot ... on [[Beale Street]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

Presley &quot;was an untrained musician who played entirely by ear. 'I don't read music,' he confessed, 'but I know what I like.' ... Because he was not a songwriter, Presley [would] rarely [have] material prepared for recording sessions...&quot; When later, as a young singer, he &quot;ventured into the recording studio he was heavily influenced by the songs he had heard on the jukebox and radio.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand, p.205&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, 1953, Presley went to Sun Records' [[Memphis Recording Service]] to record &quot;My Happiness&quot; with &quot;That's When Your Heartaches Begin&quot;, supposedly a present for his mother.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://elvis.com/elvisology/bio/elvis_1935_1957_2.asp Elvis biography: 1935–1957]&quot;.

At the time, Sun Records boss [[Sam Phillips]] was on the lookout for someone who could deliver a blend of black blues and [[boogie-woogie]] music; he thought it would be very popular among white people.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; When Phillips acquired a demo recording of &quot;Without Love (There Is Nothing)&quot; and was unable to identify the vocalist, Keisker reminded him about the young truck driver. She called him on June 26, 1954. Presley was not able to do justice to the song (though he would record it years later).&lt;ref&gt;Lichter, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips would later recall that &quot;Elvis was probably as nervous as anybody, black or white, that I had seen in front of a microphone.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clutton&quot;&gt;Everything Elvis, ISBN 0753509601&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Phillips invited local musicians [[Scotty Moore|Winfield &quot;Scotty&quot; Moore]] and [[Bill Black]] to audition Presley.

During a recording break, Presley began &quot;acting the fool&quot; first with Arthur Crudup's &quot;[[That's All Right (Mama)]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick, Peter (1992). ''The Complete 50's Masters'' (CD booklet notes).&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips quickly got them all to restart, and began taping. This was the sound he had been looking for.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The group recorded other songs, including [[Bill Monroe]]'s &quot;[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]&quot;. After the session, according to Scotty Moore, Bill Black remarked: &quot;Damn.

DJ and promoter Bob Neal became the trio's manager (replacing Scotty Moore). Moore and Black left their band, the Starlight Wranglers and, from August through October 1954, appeared with Presley at The Eagle's Nest.&lt;ref name=EarlyGigs /&gt; Presley debuted at the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' in [[Nashville]] on October 2; Hank Snow introduced Presley on stage.

Country music promoter and manager [[Tillman Franks]] booked Presley for the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' on October 16. Before Franks saw Presley, he referred to him as &quot;that new black singer with the funny name&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Naylor and Halliday, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; During Presley's first set, the reaction was muted; Franks then advised Presley to &quot;Let it all go!&quot; for the second set. House drummer [[D.J. Fontana]] (who had worked in strip clubs) complemented Presley's movements with accented beats. Bill Black also took an active part in encouraging the audience, and the crowd became more responsive.&lt;ref&gt;Naylor and Halliday, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clayton-73&gt;Clayton and Heard, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one source, regarding Presley's engagements from that time, &quot;Audiences had never before heard [such] music... [or] seen anyone who performed like Presley either. The shy, polite, mumbling boy gained self-confidence with every appearance... People watching the show were astounded and shocked, both by the ferocity of his performance, and the crowd’s reaction to it... [[Roy Orbison]] saw Presley for the first time in Odessa, Texas: 'His energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing... I just didn’t know what to make of it. There was just no reference point in the culture to compare it.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cook, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Phillips said Presley &quot;put every ounce of emotion ... into every song, almost as if he was incapable of holding back.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 1955, Sun Studios had released ten sides credited to &quot;Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill&quot;, all typical of the developing Presley style. That style proved hard to categorize; he was billed or labeled in the media as &quot;The King of Western Bop&quot;, &quot;The [[Hillbilly#Music|Hillbilly]] Cat&quot; and &quot;The Memphis Flash&quot;.&lt;ref name=Hopkins-53&gt;Hopkins 2007, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakthrough, 1956===
[[Image:Elvispresleydebutalbum.jpeg|thumb|The iconic cover of Elvis Presley's debut RCA Victor album. Photo taken on January 31, 1955]]
On January 10, Presley made his first recordings for RCA in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Stanley and Coffey, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; The session produced &quot;[[Heartbreak Hotel]]/I Was The One&quot; which was released on January 27. The public reaction to &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; prompted RCA to release it as a single in its own right (February 11).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt; By April it had hit number one in the U.S. charts, selling in excess of one million copies. 

To increase the singer's exposure, Parker finally brought Presley to national television (In March 1955, Presley had failed an audition for ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]''). He booked six [[Dorsey Brothers]]' ''Stage Show'' appearances in New York for [[CBS]], beginning January 28, 1956. Presley was introduced on the first by [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] DJ [[Bill Randle]]. He stayed in town and on January 30, he and the band headed for the RCA's New York Studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt; The sessions yielded eight songs, including &quot;My Baby Left Me&quot; and &quot;[[Blue Suede Shoes]]&quot;. The latter was the only hit single from the collection, but the recordings marked the point at which Presley started moving away from the raw, pure Sun sound to the more commercial and mainstream sound RCA had envisioned for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;

On March 23, RCA Victor released ''[[Elvis Presley (album)|Elvis Presley]]'', his first album. Like the Sun recordings, the majority of the tracks were country songs.&lt;ref&gt;Hilburn, Robert ([[2005-02-11]]). &quot;[http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/reviews/cd_review_elvis_presley.shtml Review: Elvis Presley CD]&quot;.

On April 1, Presley launched his acting career with a screen-test for [[Paramount Pictures]]. His first motion-picture, [[Love Me Tender (1956 film)|Love Me Tender]], was released on November 21 (See '[[#Acting career|Acting career]]').

Colonel Parker had also obtained a deal for two lucrative shows with [[Milton Berle]] at [[NBC]]. Presley first appeared on ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]'' from the deck of the [[USS Hancock (CV-19)|USS Hancock]] in [[San Diego]] on April 3. His performance was cheered by a live audience of appreciative sailors and their dates.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot;&gt;Jorgensen, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after, a flight taking Presley's band to Nashville for a recording session left all three badly shaken (the plane lost an engine and almost went down over Texas).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot; /&gt; After more hectic touring, Presley returned to ''The Milton Berle Show'' on June 5 and performed &quot;Hound Dog&quot; (without his guitar). Singing the song uptempo, he then began a slower version. His exaggerated, straight-legged shuffle around the microphone stand stirred the audience&amp;mdash;as did his vigorous leg shaking and hip thrusts in time to the beat. Presley's &quot;gyrations&quot; created a storm of controversy&amp;mdash;even eclipsing the '[[communist]] threat' headlines prevalent at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jorgensen-49&quot;&gt;Jorgensen, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; The press described his performance as &quot;vulgar&quot; and &quot;obscene&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jorgensen-49&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An example of press criticism can be found at Gould, Jack (June 6, 1956). &quot;[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/archives/elvis-presley-on-milton-berle-show-06-06-1956.pdf TV: New Phenomenon]&quot; (PDF).

Retrieved on [[2007-10-14]].&lt;/ref&gt; The furore was such that Presley was pressured to explain himself on the local New York City TV show ''[[Hy Gardner]] Calling'': &quot;Rock and roll music, if you like it, and you feel it, you can't help but move to it. That's what happens to me. I have to move around. I can't stand still.

Presley disliked the name, calling it &quot;one of the most childish expressions I ever heard.&quot;&lt;ref name=Farren-89&gt;Farren and Marchbank, p.89&lt;/ref&gt;

From April 23, Presley was scheduled to perform four weeks at the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]&amp;mdash;billed this time as &quot;the Atomic Powered Singer&quot; (Since [[Nevada]] was the home of the U.S.'s [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] testing, Parker thought the name would be catchy). His shows were so badly received by critics and the conservative, middle-aged guests, that Colonel Parker cut short the engagement from four weeks to two.&lt;ref name=Stanley-32&gt;Stanley and Coffey, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; . D.J. Fontana said, &quot;I don't think the people there were ready for Elvis..... We tried everything we knew. Usually Elvis could get them on his side. It didn't work that time&quot;. While in Vegas, Presley saw [[Freddie Bell and the Bellboys]] live, and liked their version of [[Leiber and Stoller]]'s &quot;[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]&quot;.

The Berle shows drew such huge ratings that [[Steve Allen]] ([[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]), not a fan of rock and roll, booked him for one appearance in New York on July 1. Allen wanted &quot;to do a show the whole family can watch&quot; and introduced a &quot;new Elvis&quot; in white bow tie and black tails. Presley sang &quot;Hound Dog&quot; for less than a minute to a [[Basset Hound]] in a [[top hat]]. According to one author, &quot;Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd...

Instead we worked him into the comedy fabric of our program.” “We certainly didn't inhibit Elvis' then-notorious pelvic gyrations, but I think the fact that he had on formal evening attire made him, purely on his own, slightly alter his presentation.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20030710093740/http://steveallen.com/television_pioneer/steve_allen_comedy_show.htm The Steve Allen Comedy Show]&lt;/ref&gt; The day after (July 2), the single &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was recorded and Scotty Moore said they were &quot;all angry about their treatment the previous night&quot;.&lt;ref name=Beebe /&gt; (Presley often referred to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career.)&lt;ref name=Elvis56&gt;Raymond, Susan (Director) (1987, Re-released 2000).

Country vocalists [[The Jordanaires]] accompanied Presley on ''The Steve Allen Show'' and their first recording session together produced &quot;[[Any Way You Want Me]]&quot;, &quot;[[Don't Be Cruel]]&quot; and &quot;Hound Dog&quot;. The Jordanaires would work with the singer through the 1960s.

Though Presley had been unhappy, Allen's show had, for the first time, beaten ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in the ratings, causing a critical Sullivan ([[CBS]]) to book Presley for three appearances for an unprecedented $50,000.&lt;ref&gt;For more on the TV host rivalries of the period, see &quot;[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/steveallens/steveallens.htm The Steve Allen Show (And Various Related Programs)]&quot;.

Presley was even seen as a &quot;definite danger to the security of the United States.&quot; His actions and motions were called &quot;a [[Striptease|strip-tease]] with clothes on&quot; or &quot;sexual self-gratification on stage.&quot; They were compared with &quot;[[masturbation]] or riding a microphone.&quot; Some saw the singer as a sexual [[perversion|pervert]], and psychologists feared that teenaged girls and boys could easily be &quot;aroused to sexual indulgence and perversion by certain types of motions and [[hysteria]]&amp;mdash;the type that was exhibited at the Presley show.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See Fensch, Thomas. ''The FBI Files on Elvis Presley'', pp.15-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Presley would insist, however, that there was nothing vulgar about his stage act, saying: &quot;Some people tap their feet, some people snap their fingers, and some people sway back and forth. I just sorta do ‘em all together, I guess.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotesandsayings.com/gelvispresley.htm Elvis Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1956, a [[Florida]] judge called Presley a &quot;savage&quot; and threatened to arrest him if he shook his body while performing in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]]. The judge declared that Presley's music was undermining the youth of America. Throughout the performance (which was filmed by police), he kept still as ordered, except for wiggling a finger in mockery at the ruling.&lt;ref name=Marino&gt;Marino, Rick. &quot;[http://www.ladyluckmusic.com/radio/guest/ Elvis and Jacksonville, Florida]&quot;.

He was alleged to have said in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]: &quot;The only thing Negro people can do for me is to buy my records and shine my shoes.&quot; Presley always denied saying, or ever wanting to say, such a racist remark. ''[[Jet magazine|Jet]]'' magazine, run by and for African Americans, was subsequently keen to investigate the story. The singer's acquaintances in Memphis were pursued for any other racist anecdotes to back up the perception that Presley was racist, but none was found. Nor could any evidence be found of the date, location and persons involved when the remark was allegedly made (Presley had never visited Boston). However, the ''Jet'' journalist did find plenty of testimony that Presley judged people &quot;regardless of race, color or creed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Natalie (August 17, 2003). &quot;[http://www.gratefuldread.net/archives/cat/000733.html The 'King' Has Left the Building]&quot;.

His parents moved home in Memphis, but the singer lived there briefly. With increased concerns over privacy and security, ''[[Graceland]]'' was bought and renovated in 1957, a mansion with several acres of land. This was Presley's primary residence until his death.

Presley's record sales grew quickly throughout the late 1950s, with hits like &quot;[[All Shook Up]]&quot;, &quot;[[Teddy Bear (song)|(Let me Be Your) Teddy Bear]]&quot; and &quot;[[Too Much (Elvis Presley song)|Too Much]]&quot;.

On December 20, 1957, Presley received his [[Conscription in the United States|draft notice]]. [[Hal Wallis]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] had already spent $350,000 on the film ''[[King Creole]]'', and did not want to suspend or cancel the project. The Memphis Draft Board granted Presley a deferment to finish it. On March 24, 1958, he was inducted as US Army private #53310761 and completed basic training at [[Fort Hood]], [[Texas]] on September 17, 1958, before being posted to [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]], Germany with the 3rd Armored Division, where his service took place from October 1, 1958 until March 2, 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Elder, Daniel K. &quot;[http://ncohistory.com/files/RemarkableSgts.pdf Remarkable Sergeants: Ten Vignettes of Noteworthy NCOs]&quot;. ''ncohistory.com''. Retrieved on [[2007-11-13]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's down-to-earth nature, and his generosity while in service. To supplement meager under-clothing supplies, Presley bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit. He also donated his Army pay to charity, and purchased all the TV sets for personnel on the base at that time.&lt;ref name=Clayton-160&gt;Clayton and Heard, p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

Presley had chosen not to join 'Special Services', which would have allowed him to avoid certain duties and maintain his public profile.&lt;ref&gt;Lichter, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to receive massive media coverage, with much speculation echoing Presley's own concerns about his enforced absence damaging his career. However, early in 1958, RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes and Freddy Bienstock of Hill and Range (Presley's main music publishers) had both pushed for recording sessions and strong song material, the aim being to release regular hit recordings during Presley's two-year hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; Hit singles&amp;mdash;and six albums&amp;mdash;duly followed during that period.

As Presley's fame grew, his mother continued to drink excessively and began to gain weight. She had wanted her son to succeed, &quot;but... [the] hysteria of the crowd frightened her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; In early August 1958, doctors had diagnosed [[hepatitis]] and her condition worsened. Presley was granted emergency leave to visit her, arriving in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, Gladys Presley died of [[heart failure]], aged forty-six. Presley was distraught, &quot;grieving almost constantly&quot; for days.&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick 1999, p.480&lt;/ref&gt;

Some months later, in Germany, &quot;[a] sergeant had introduced [Presley] to [[amphetamines]] when they were on maneuvers at [[Grafenwöhr]]... it seemed like half the guys in the company were taking them.&quot; Friends around Presley, like [[Diamond Joe Esposito|Joe Esposito]], also began taking them, &quot;if only to keep up with Elvis, who was practically evangelical about their benefits.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated7&quot; /&gt; The Army also introduced Presley to [[karate]]&amp;mdash;something which he studied seriously, even including it in his later live performances.&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick 1994, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;{{fn|d}}

Presley returned to the U.S. on March 2, 1960, and was honorably discharged with the rank of sergeant on March 5.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://en.allexperts.com/q/Presley-Elvis-562/elvis-14.htm What was his rank when he got out of the army?]&quot;. ''AllExperts''. Retrieved on [[2008-08-23]].&lt;/ref&gt; Any doubts Elvis had about his popularity must have been dispelled as &quot;The train which carried him from [[New Jersey]] to Memphis was mobbed all the way, with Presley being called upon to appear ... at whistle-stops&quot; to placate his fans.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew-Walker 1979, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; 

===First post-Army recordings===
The first recording session, on March 20, 1960, was attended by all of the significant businessmen involved with Presley; none had heard him sing for two years, and there were inevitable concerns about him being able to recapture his previous success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jorgensen-120&quot;&gt;Jorgensen, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; The session was the first at which Presley was recorded using a three-track machine, allowing better quality, postsession remixing and [[stereophonic]] recording.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jorgensen-120&quot;&gt;Jorgensen, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; This, and a further session in April, yielded some of Presley's best-selling songs. &quot;[['O Sole Mio|It's Now or Never]]&quot; ended with Presley &quot;soaring up to an incredible top G sharp ... pure magic.&quot;&lt;ref name=Matthew-Walker-49 /&gt; His voice on &quot;[[Are You Lonesome Tonight?]]&quot; has been described as &quot;natural, unforced, dead in tune, and totally distinctive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthew-Walker-49&quot;&gt;Matthew-Walker 1979, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; Although some tracks were uptempo, none could be described as &quot;rock and roll&quot;, and many of them marked a significant change in musical direction.&lt;ref name=Matthew-Walker-49 /&gt; Most tracks found their way on to an album&amp;mdash;''[[Elvis is Back!]]''&amp;mdash;described by one critic as &quot;a triumph on every level... It was as if Elvis had... broken down the barriers of genre and prejudice to express everything he heard in all the kinds of music he loved&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; The album was also notable because of Homer [[Boots Randolph]]'s acclaimed saxophone playing on the blues songs &quot;[[Like A Baby]]&quot; and &quot;[[Reconsider Baby]]&quot;, the latter being described as &quot;a refutation of those who do not recognize what a phenomenal artist Presley was.&quot;&lt;ref name=Matthew-Walker-49 /&gt;

===Acting career===
{{see also|Elvis Presley filmography}}
In 1956, Presley launched his career as a film actor. He screen-tested for Paramount Pictures by lip-synching &quot;[[Blue Suede Shoes]]&quot; and performing a scene as 'Bill Starbuck' in [[The Rainmaker (film)|''The Rainmaker'']].&lt;ref name=Rain&gt;[http://oldies.about.com/od/elvis/a/elvis1956_3.htm Elvis Presley Timeline] Retrieved on [[2008-07-31]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being quietly confident that ''The Rainmaker'' would be his first film&amp;mdash;even going as far as saying so in an interview&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049653/trivia The Rainmaker Trivia] Retrieved July 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;the role eventually went to [[Burt Lancaster]].&lt;ref name=Rain/&gt;

After signing a seven-year contract with Paramount, Presley made his big-screen début with the musical western, ''[[Love Me Tender (1956 film)|Love Me Tender]]''. It was panned by the critics but did well at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;Harbinson, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;
The original title&amp;mdash;''The [[Reno Brothers]]''&amp;mdash;was changed to capitalize on the advanced sales of the song &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;. The majority of Presley's films were musical comedies made to &quot;sell records and produce high revenues.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Falk and Falk, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in more dramatic films, like ''[[Jailhouse Rock (1957 film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'' and ''[[King Creole]]''. The erotic, if not homoerotic,&lt;ref&gt;See Brett Farmer, ''Spectacular Passions: Cinema, Fantasy, Gay Male Spectatorships'' (Duke University Press, 2000), p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; dance sequence to the song &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, which Presley choreographed himself, &quot;is considered by many as his greatest performance ever captured on film.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Billy Poore, ''Rockabilly: A Forty-Year Journey'' (1998), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; To maintain box office success, he would later even shift &quot;into [[beefcake]] formula comedy mode for a few years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9708/elvis/alive/elvis.hollywood/index.html Elvis goes Hollywood: Fun in the sun, and not much else]&quot;. ''[[CNN.com]]''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-19]].&lt;/ref&gt; He also made one non-musical western, ''[[Charro!]]''.

Presley stopped live performing after his Army service with the exception, ironically&amp;mdash;given Sinatra's previously scathing criticism&amp;mdash;of a guest appearance on ''[[The Frank Sinatra Timex Show: Welcome Home Elvis]]'' (1960). He also performed three charity concerts&amp;mdash;two in Memphis and one in Pearl Harbor (1961).&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick 1999, pp.89-91&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Army, Presley had said on many occasions that &quot;more than anything, he wanted to be taken seriously as a dramatic actor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick 1999, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; His manager, with an eye on long-term earnings, negotiated a multi-picture seven-year contract with [[Hal Wallis]].&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick 1999, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; The singer would later star alongside several established or up-coming actors, including [[Walter Matthau]], [[Carolyn Jones]], [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Charles Bronson]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]], [[Mary Tyler Moore]]&amp;mdash;and even a very young [[Kurt Russell]] in his screen debut. Although Presley was praised by directors, like [[Michael Curtiz]], as polite and hardworking (and as having an exceptional memory), &quot;he was definitely not the most talented actor around.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Verswijver, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; Others were more charitable; critic [[Bosley Crowther]] of the ''New York Times'' said: &quot;This boy can act,&quot; about his portrayal in ''King Creole''. Director [[Joe Pasternak]] believed &quot;Elvis should be given more meaty parts. ... He would be a good actor. He should do more important pictures.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hopkins-185&gt;Hopkins 2007, p.185&lt;/ref&gt;

The movies he did make, and the [[American International Pictures|AIP]] beach movies (which were mainly made for an early sixties teenage audience), were generally criticized as a &quot;pantheon of bad taste.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Caine, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; The scripts of his movies &quot;were all the same, the songs progressively worse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kirchberg and Hendricks, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; For ''[[Blue Hawaii]]'', &quot;fourteen songs were cut in just three days.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Julie Parrish, who appeared in ''[[Paradise, Hawaiian Style]]'', says that Presley hated many of the songs chosen for his films; he &quot;couldn't stop laughing while he was recording&quot; one of them.&lt;ref&gt;Lisanti 2000, pp.19, 136&lt;/ref&gt; Others noted that the songs seemed to be &quot;written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; However, several reputable songwriters/partnerships contributed soundtrack songs, including [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]], [[Don Robertson (songwriter)|Don Robertson]], [[Sid Tepper]] and [[Roy C. Bennett]], and [[Otis Blackwell]] and [[Winfield Scott]]. Whatever the quality of the material, some observers have argued that Presley generally sang well in the studio, with commitment, and always played with distinguished musicians and backing singers.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew-Walker 1979, p.66&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' wrote that in his movies &quot;Elvis Presley, aggressively [[bisexual]] in appeal, knowingly [[eroticism|erotic]], [was] acting like a [[crucifixion|crucified]] [[houri]] and singing with a kind of machine-made [[surrealism]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Sight and Sound'', The British Film Institute, British Institute of Adult Education (1992), p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics would later claim that &quot;No major star suffered through more bad movies than Elvis Presley.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, p.511&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ElvisVivaLasVegas.jpg|thumb|right|Elvis in the film ''[[Viva Las Vegas]]'' (1964)]]
Presley movies were nevertheless very popular, and he &quot;became a film genre of his own.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lisanti 2000, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Hal Wallis would later remark: &quot;An Elvis Presley picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elvispresley.com.au/ Elvis Presley Movie Facts] Retrieved on [[2008-07-30]]&lt;/ref&gt; Elvis on celluloid was the only chance for his world-wide fans to see him, in the absence of live appearances (the only time he toured outside of the U.S. was in Canada in 1957).{{fn|e}} His ''Blue Hawaii'' even &quot;boosted the new state's tourism. Some of his most enduring and popular songs came from those [kind of] movies,&quot; like &quot;[[Can't Help Falling in Love]],&quot; &quot;[[Return to Sender (song)|Return to Sender]]&quot; and &quot;[[Viva Las Vegas (song)|Viva Las Vegas]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, vii&lt;/ref&gt; His 1960s films and soundtracks grossed some $280 million.&lt;ref&gt;Alagna, ''Elvis Presley''&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 1968, the ''New York Times'' wrote: &quot;Three times a year Elvis Presley ... [makes] multimillion-dollar feature-length films, with holiday titles like &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;, &quot;[[Fun in Acapulco]]&quot;, &quot;[[Viva Las Vegas]]&quot;, &quot;[[Tickle Me]]&quot;, &quot;[[Easy Come, Easy Go]]&quot;, &quot;[[Live a Little, Love a Little]]&quot; and the latest in the series, &quot;Chataqua&quot; [released as ''Charro!'']. For each film Elvis receives a million dollars in wages and 50 per cent of the profits. ... [E]very film yields an LP sound-track record which may sell as many as two-million copies.&quot;

In 1964, [[Richard Burton]] and [[Peter O'Toole]] had starred in Hal Wallis' acclaimed ''[[Becket (film)|Becket]]''. Wallis admitted to the press that the financing of such quality productions was only possible by making a series of profitable B-movies starring Presley. He branded Wallis &quot;a double-dealing sonofabitch&quot; (and he thought little better of Tom Parker), realizing there had never been any intention to let him develop into a serious actor.&lt;ref name = &quot;pefciv&quot;&gt;Guralnick 1999, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;

Presley was similarly exploited the following year with the film ''[[Tickle Me]]''. [[Allied Artists]] had serious financial problems and hoped a Presley film would help them &quot;stay afloat&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tickle-Me&gt;[http://www.elvispresley.com.au/elvis/presley/tickle_me.shtml Behind the Scenes of ''Tickle Me'']&lt;/ref&gt; By agreeing to a lower fee, using previously recorded songs and filming on the studio back-lot, Allied Artists were able to keep costs very low.&lt;ref name=Tickle-Me/&gt; Considered one of the weakest of all Presley pictures, it became the third highest grossing picture in Allied Artists' history, and saved them from bankruptcy at the time.&lt;ref name=Tickle-Me/&gt;

Presley was one of the highest paid actors during the 1960s, but times were changing. &quot;[The] Elvis Presley film was becoming passé. Young people were tuning in, dropping out and doing acid. Musical acts like [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Grateful Dead]], [[The Doors]], [[Janis Joplin]] and many others were dominating the airwaves. Elvis Presley was not considered cool as he once was.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lisanti 2000, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Priscilla Presley recalls: &quot;He blamed his fading popularity on his humdrum movies&quot; and &quot;... loathed their stock plots and short shooting schedules.&quot; She also notes: &quot;He could have demanded better, more substantial scripts, but he didn't.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Presley, p.188&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Change of Habit]]'' (1969) was the singer's final movie role. His last two films were concert documentaries in the early 1970s, though Presley was keen to consider dramatic movie roles.&lt;ref name=George-Warren&gt;George-Warren, Romanowski and Pareles, ''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock And Roll''.

Retrieved on [[2007-10-14]].&lt;/ref&gt; (See: '[[#Influence of Colonel Parker and others|Influence of Colonel Parker and others]]').

As well as the formulaic movie songs of the 1960s, Presley added to the studio recordings of ''Elvis Is Back'', by recording other noteworthy songs like &quot;[[She's Not You]]&quot;, &quot;[[Suspicion (Pomus/Shuman song)|Suspicion]],&quot; &quot;[[Little Sister (Pomus/Shuman song)|Little Sister]]&quot;, &quot;[[(You're the) Devil in Disguise]]&quot; and &quot;[[It Hurts Me]].&quot; In 1966 he recorded a cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s &quot;[[Tomorrow is a Long Time]]&quot; (which RCA Victor relegated to a bonus track on the soundtrack album for ''[[Spinout]]''). He also produced two gospel albums: ''[[His Hand in Mine]]'' (1960) and ''[[How Great Thou Art (album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1966). In 1967, he recorded some well-received singles, like [[Guitar Man]], by songwriter/guitar player [[Jerry Reed]]. However, &quot;during the Beatles era (1963-70), only six Elvis singles reached number ten or better. 'Suspicious Minds' was the lone number one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kirchberg, Connie and Marc Hendricks 1999, p.66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;The Fab Four&quot; meet &quot;The King&quot;===
During filming of ''Paradise, Hawaiian Style'', Presley returned to his [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel Air]] home. [[The Beatles]] were at the end of their second U.S. tour. Colonel Parker had been negotiating a meeting for some time, through The Beatles' manager [[Brian Epstein]], though Parker simply saw it as a valuable publicity opportunity (He had apparently even tried to get the group and Presley to perform the closing song in the same movie, but The Beatles' film contract precluded it). The group arrived in Bel Air amid a flurry of elaborate security arrangements made by Parker at 10pm, on August 27, 1965.&lt;ref name=Guralnick-1999-211&gt;Guralnick 1999, p.211&lt;/ref&gt; The visit lasted about four hours. Many of Presley's closest and trusted friends&amp;mdash; members of the so-called &quot;[[Memphis Mafia]]&quot;&amp;mdash;were present, including school friend and bodyguard Red West, Marty Lacker, [[Jerry Schilling]], Larry Geller and their girlfriends, etc..&lt;ref name=Guralnick-1999-211/&gt;

Biographer Peter Guralnick maintains that Presley was at best &quot;lukewarm&quot; about playing host to people he did not really know, and it took a while for everyone to feel comfortable.&lt;ref name=Guralnick-1999-211/&gt; [[Paul McCartney]] later said: &quot;It was one of the great meetings of my life. I think he liked us. I think at that time, he may have felt a little bit threatened, but he didn't say anything. We certainly didn't feel any antagonism. I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;elvispresleynews1&quot;&gt;[http://www.elvispresleynews.com/Beatles.html Elvis Presley News]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marty Lacker recalls Presley saying: &quot;'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Memphis1&quot;&gt;Nash, Smith, Lacker and Fike ''Elvis and the Memphis Mafia'', p359-360&lt;/ref&gt; The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session.&lt;ref name=&quot;elvispresleynews1&quot;/&gt; &quot;They all went to the piano,&quot; says Lacker, &quot;and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs, [[Chuck Berry]] songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on &quot;[[I Feel Fine]]&quot;, and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Memphis1&quot;/&gt;

[[Ringo Starr]] played pool with two others that night; [[George Harrison]] &quot;looked to most of the guys to be stoned&quot; on arrival and allegedly smoked a joint with Larry Geller and talked about [[Hinduism]] (see: '[[#Influence of Colonel Parker and others|Influence of Colonel Parker and others]]'). Parker played roulette with Epstein.&lt;ref name=Guralnick-1999-211/&gt; However, Guralnick claims The Beatles were, overall, disappointed by the visit. They still reciprocated with an invitation for Elvis to visit them, but only some of Presley's &quot;Memphis Mafia&quot; accepted. &quot;[[John Lennon]] went out of his way to tell Jerry [Schilling] how much the evening had meant to him&quot; and asked Schilling to tell Presley, &quot;'[I]f it hadn't been for him I would have been nothing.'&quot; Schilling says that when he told Presley he did not say anything, but &quot;just kind of smiled.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick 1999, p.212&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Relationships of Elvis Presley}}
Presley's sexual appeal and photogenic looks have been acknowledged. Director [[Steve Binder]], not a fan of Presley's music at the time, recalled from the [[Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special|'68 Comeback Special]]: &quot;I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Binder&quot;/&gt;

According to [[Marjorie Garber]], a &quot;male rock critic writing in 1970 praised Elvis as 'The master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl.' ... rumor had it that into his skin-tight jeans was sewn a lead bar to suggest a weapon of heroic proportions.&quot; She cites a boyhood friend of Presley's who claims the singer actually used a cardboard toilet roll tube to make it &quot;look to the girls up front like he had one helluva thing there inside his pants.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Garber, Marjorie, ''Vested Interests: Cross-Dressing &amp; Cultural Anxiety'', p.382.&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Sullivan had apparently heard similar rumors and instructed his director Marlo Lewis to film only Presley's chest and head for his final Sullivan appearance. However, Lewis was skeptical about Presley wearing such a device and says simply: &quot;It wasn't there&quot;.&lt;ref name=Clayton-118&gt;Clayton and Heard, p.118&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ann-Margret]] (Presley's co-star in ''[[Viva Las Vegas]]'') refers to Presley as her &quot;soulmate&quot; but has revealed little else.&lt;ref&gt;Margret, ''Ann-Margret: My Story''&lt;/ref&gt; A publicity campaign about Presley and Margret's romance was launched during the filming of ''Viva Las Vegas'',&lt;ref&gt;Presley, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; which helped to increase Margret's popularity.&lt;ref name=Gamson-46&gt;Gamson, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrington and Bielby, p.273&lt;/ref&gt; Presley apparently dated many female co-stars for publicity purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Ruthe (August 3, 1997). &quot;Girls!

Former partner [[Linda Thompson]] says they did not consummate their relationship until after a few months of dating. After they broke up in December 1976, many say Presley never had sex again. His last girlfriend, [[Ginger Alden]] claims to be engaged to Presley at the time of his death, though her story is contradicted by many of Presley's close friends.

===Marriage to Priscilla===
{{main|Priscilla Presley|Lisa Marie Presley}}

Elvis and Priscilla met in 1959 at a party in [[Bad Nauheim|Bad Nauheim, Germany]] during his stay in the army.&lt;ref name=Clutton/&gt; She was 14 at the time they met, while he was 24. They quickly began a serious relationship and frequently visited each other until he left Germany in 1960.

Priscilla and Elvis stayed in contact over the phone, though they would not see each other again until the summer of 1962, when Priscilla's parents agreed to let her visit for two weeks.&lt;ref name=Clutton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Priscilla, Biography Channel&lt;/ref&gt; After another visit at Christmas, Priscilla's parents finally let her move to America for good.&lt;ref name=Clutton/&gt; Part of the agreement was that she would be privately educated, to complete her senior year, and live with Elvis' father and his wife, Dee, in their home&amp;mdash;due to Presley's difficulty with accepting his stepmother, he arranged for them to live in a separate house on the ''Graceland'' estate.&lt;ref name=Clutton/&gt; However, it wasn't long until Priscilla was moved into ''Graceland'' to live with Elvis.&lt;ref name=Clutton/&gt; 

In her autobiography, ''[[Elvis and Me]]'', Priscilla says that Elvis refused to have sex with her until they were married. However, biographer [[Suzanne Finstad]] writes that Priscilla and Elvis slept together on their second date.&lt;ref&gt;Finstad, Suzanne, ''Child Bride: The Untold Story of Priscilla Beaulieu Presley'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortly before Christmas 1966, Presley proposed to Priscilla. They married on May 1, 1967 at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas. In typical fashion, Colonel Parker had arranged a photo session and press conference to be conducted shortly after the ceremony. According to Finstad, this marriage was part of a mastermind for fame hatched by Priscilla and her mother.

Their only child, [[Lisa Marie Presley|Lisa Marie]], was born on February 1, 1968.

===Influence of Colonel Parker and others===
{{main|Colonel Tom Parker|Memphis Mafia}}
By 1967, Colonel Tom Parker had negotiated a contract that gave him 50% of Presley's earnings. Parker's excessive gambling&amp;mdash;and his subsequent need to have Presley signed up to commercially lucrative contracts&amp;mdash;may well have adversely affected the course of Presley's career.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2002/08/18/story343531628.asp. Retrieved on [[2008-07-30]].&lt;/ref&gt; Parker's concerns about his own U.S. citizenship may have also been a factor in Parker and the singer never exploiting Presley's popularity abroad (see: '[[#1973–1976|1973–1976]]'). It has been claimed that Presley's original band was fired in order to isolate the singer: Parker wanted no one close to Presley to suggest that a better management deal might exist.&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, ''Colonel Tom Parker: The Curious Life of Elvis Presley's Eccentric Manager''&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as signing Presley to RCA Victor, Parker also cut a deal with Hill and Range Publishing Company to create a separate entity&amp;mdash; &quot;Elvis Presley Music Incorporated&quot;&amp;mdash;to handle all of Presley's songs and accrued royalties. Parker would later use this set-up to make songwriters relinquish some of their royalties; this ultimately resulted in the better writers refusing to provide songs for Presley, causing a marked decline in the quality of his output over the years.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt;
Presley apparently disliked several songs&amp;mdash;even some of the earliest top sellers he became famous for (which suggests commercial influences were sometimes greater than his own desires). Presley's friend Jerry Schilling relates that one way to really annoy the singer was to play a song, like &quot;All Shook Up&quot;, on a jukebox at one of his private parties. &quot;Get that crap off,&quot; was his typical reaction.&lt;ref name=Schilling&gt;Schilling, Jerry ([[2006-07-10]]). &quot;[http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/books/book_me_and_a_guy_named_elvis2.shtml Why I Wrote Me And A Guy Named Elvis]&quot;. ''elvis.com.au''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-23]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, record producer [[Chips Moman]] and Presley recorded with Moman's own musicians at his American Sound Studios in Memphis. Given the control exerted by RCA and the music publishers, this was a significant departure. Moman still had to deal with Hill and Range staff on site and was not happy with their song choices. Moman could only get the best out of the singer when he threatened to quit the sessions and asked Presley to remove the &quot;aggravating&quot; publishing personnel from the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton and Heard, p.264-5&lt;/ref&gt; RCA Victor executive Joan Deary was later full of praise for the song choices and superior results of Moman's work, like &quot;[[In the Ghetto]]&quot; and &quot;[[Suspicious Minds]]&quot;, but despite this, no producer was to override Hill and Range's control again.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton and Heard, p.267&lt;/ref&gt;

According to life-long friend and &quot;[[Memphis Mafia]]&quot; member George Klein, over the years Presley was offered lead roles in the film ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' and in ''[[West Side Story]]''. [[Robert Mitchum]] personally offered him the lead in ''[[Thunder Road]]''.&lt;ref name=Clayton-226&gt;Clayton and Heard, p.226&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, [[Barbra Streisand]] approached Presley to star with her in the remake of ''[[A Star is Born]]''. In each case, any ambitions the singer may have had to play such parts were thwarted by his manager's negotiating demands, or his flat refusals.&lt;ref name=George-Warren&gt;George-Warren, Romanowski and Pareles, ''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock And Roll''. Excerpt in &quot;[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/elvispresley/biography Elvis Presley biography]&quot;. ''Rolling Stone''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-14]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Marty Lacker regarded Parker as a &quot;hustler and scam artist&quot; who abused Presley's trust, but Lacker acknowledged that Parker was a master promoter.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Lacker, Fike and Smith, ''Elvis Aron Presley: Revelations from the Memphis Mafia''&lt;/ref&gt; Priscilla Presley noted that &quot;Elvis detested the business side of his career. He would sign a contract without even reading it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Presley, ''Elvis and Me''&lt;/ref&gt;

Presley's father in turn distrusted Lacker and the other members of the &quot;Memphis Mafia&quot;; he thought they collectively exercised an unhealthy influence over his son.&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, p.79&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[I]t was no wonder&quot; that as the singer &quot;slid into addiction and torpor, no one raised the alarm: to them, Elvis was the bank, and it had to remain open.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, John (March 27, 2006). &quot;Talking about Graceland&quot;. ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Musician Tony Brown noted the urgent need to reverse Presley's declining health as the singer toured in the mid-1970s. &quot;But we all knew it was hopeless because Elvis was surrounded by that little circle of people... all those so-called friends and... bodyguards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Clayton and Heard, p.339&lt;/ref&gt;

Larry Geller became Presley's hairdresser in 1964. Unlike others in the &quot;Memphis Mafia&quot;, Geller was interested in 'spiritual studies', and was subsequently viewed with suspicion and scorn by the singer's manager and friends.&lt;ref name=Guralnick-1999-173&gt;Guralnick 1999, p.173&lt;/ref&gt; From their first conversation, Geller recalls how Presley revealed his secret thoughts and anxieties, how &quot;there's got to be a reason... why I was chosen to be Elvis Presley.'&quot;&lt;ref name=Guralnick-1999-173/&gt; He then poured out his heart in &quot;an almost painful rush of words and emotions,&quot; telling Geller about his mother and the hollowness of his Hollywood life, things he could not share with anyone around him. Thereafter, Presley voraciously read books Geller supplied, on religion and mysticism. Perhaps most tellingly, he revealed to Geller: &quot;I swear to God, no one knows how lonely I get and how empty I really feel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick 1999, p.174 and in passim&lt;/ref&gt; Presley would be preoccupied by such matters for much of his life, taking trunkloads of books with him on tour.&lt;ref name=DrFeelgood/&gt;

Presley showed interest in many beliefs, including [[Mormonism]]. A [[Book of Mormon]] owned by Presley (containing notes allegedly written by the singer) was given to [[The Osmonds|Alan Osmond]] after his death, and is now said to be in the church's archives in [[Salt Lake City]] (A second copy may have been given to Presley by Mormon Ed Parker, a karate instructor).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/84/story_8421_1.html Beliefnet.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,650195503,00.html Deseret News Elvis almost LDS?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Linda Thompson (actress)|Linda Thompson]], Presley's girlfriend after his separation, notes: &quot;[H]e really followed the [[bible]] and he also was on a spiritual quest to find out how other people of other faiths lived their lives... he used to wear an Egyptian [[ankh]], a [[star of David]] and a [[crucifix]] around his neck.

===1968 comeback===
{{main|Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special}}
[[Image:ElvisPresley-OneNight.jpg|thumb|150 px|Elvis Presley in his [[Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special|'68 Comeback Special]], airing on [[NBC]], December 3, 1968]]
In 1968, even Presley's version of Jerry Reed's hook-laden &quot;Guitar Man&quot; had failed to enter the U.S. Top 40. He continued to issue movie soundtrack albums that sold poorly compared to those of films like ''Blue Hawaii'' from 1961. It had also been nearly six years since the single &quot;[[Good Luck Charm]]&quot; had topped the [[Billboard Hot 100]].&lt;ref name=Comeback&gt;Kubernick, The Complete '68 Comeback Special Booklet&lt;/ref&gt;

Presley was, by now, &quot;profoundly&quot; unhappy with his career.&lt;ref name = &quot;pefciv&quot;/&gt; Colonel Parker's plans once again included television, and he arranged for Presley to appear in his own special. The singer had not been on television since Frank Sinatra's Timex special in May of 1960.&lt;ref name=Comeback/&gt;. Parker shrewdly manoeuvred a deal with [[NBC]]'s Tom Sarnoff which included the network's commitment to financing a future Presley feature film&amp;mdash;something that Parker had found increasingly difficult to secure.&lt;ref name=Comeback/&gt;

The special was made in June, but was first aired on December 3, 1968 as a Christmas telecast called simply ''Elvis''. Later dubbed the '''68 Comeback Special'' by fans and critics, the show featured some lavishly staged studio productions. Other songs however, were performed live with a band in front of small audience&amp;mdash;Presley's first live appearance as a performer since 1961. The live segments saw Presley clad in black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style&amp;mdash;reminiscent of his rock and roll days. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called it &quot;a performance of emotional grandeur and historical resonance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RS&quot;/&gt; Jon Landau in ''Eye'' magazine remarked: &quot;There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made [[Jim Morrison]] green with envy.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hopkins-215&gt;Hopkins 2007, p.215&lt;/ref&gt; Its success was helped by director and co-producer, Steve Binder, who worked hard to reassure the nervous singer&lt;ref name=&quot;Binder&quot;&gt;Binder, Steve ([[2005-07-08]]). &quot;[http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/interview_steve_binder.shtml Interview with Steve Binder, director of Elvis' 68 Comeback Special]&quot;. ''elvis.com.au''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-19]].&lt;/ref&gt; and to produce a show that was not just an hour of Christmas songs, as Colonel Parker had originally planned.&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick 1999, p.293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Binder2&gt;Binder, Steve (Aired: August 14, 2007). &quot;Comeback Special&quot;. ''[[BBC]] Radio Two''.&lt;/ref&gt;

By January, 1969, one of the key songs written specifically for the special, &quot;[[If I Can Dream]]&quot;, reached number 12.&lt;ref name=Comeback/&gt;. The soundtrack of the special also broke into the Top 10. On December 4, when the TV ratings were released, NBC reported that Presley had captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. It was the network's number one rated show that season.&lt;ref name=Comeback/&gt;

Jerry Schilling recalls: &quot;The '68 special inspired Elvis; reminding him what he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack. What he had to wear. He was out of prison, man.&quot; Steve Binder said of Presley's reaction: &quot;I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, &quot;Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life. I give you my word I will never sing a song I don't believe in.&quot;&lt;ref name=Comeback/&gt;

Buoyed by the experience, Presley engaged in the prolific series of recording sessions at American Sound Studios, which lead to the acclaimed ''[[From Elvis in Memphis]]'' (Chips Moman was its uncredited producer).&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, p.281&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by ''[[From Memphis To Vegas/From Vegas To Memphis]]'', a double-album. The same sessions lead to the hit singles &quot;In the Ghetto&quot;, &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;, &quot;[[Kentucky Rain]]&quot; and &quot;[[Don't Cry Daddy]]&quot;.

===Return to live performances===
In 1969, Presley was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of ''Elvis'', many new offers came in from around the world.&lt;ref name=Vegas1&gt;The King on The Road, Elvis Presley Enterprises&lt;/ref&gt; The [[London Palladium]] wanted an &quot;Elvis Spectacular&quot; and offered Parker $28,000 for a one week engagement. He responded: &quot;That's fine for me, now how much can you get for Elvis?&quot;&lt;ref name=Vegas1/&gt;. By May, the brand new [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] announced that it had booked Presley; he was scheduled to perform from July 31, after [[Barbra Streisand]] opened the new venue.&lt;ref name=Vegas1/&gt;

Presley duly delivered fifty-seven shows over four weeks at the hotel, which had the largest showroom in the city. He had assembled some of the finest musicians&amp;mdash;including an orchestra&amp;mdash;and some of the best [[Soul music|soul]]/gospel back-up singers available.&lt;ref name=Vegas1/&gt;.

Despite such a prestigious backing, Presley was nervous; he had last appeared in Las Vegas at the New Frontier Hotel in 1956 and it was considered a disaster. Parker subsequently promoted Elvis' appearances all over Las Vegas; he rented every available billboard and took out full-page advertisements in local and trade papers. The lobby of the International prominently displayed Presley souvenirs; records, T-shirts, straw boaters and stuffed animals. Parker wanted to make sure that Presley's return to the stage would be the [[show business]] event of the year, and hotel owner [[Kirk Kerkorian]] planned to send his own plane to New York to fly in the rock press for the debut performance.&lt;ref name=Vegas1/&gt;

Presley took to the stage with no introduction. The audience&amp;mdash;which included [[Pat Boone]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Wayne Newton]], [[Dick Clark]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[George Hamilton]], [[Angie Dickinson]], and [[Henry Mancini]]&amp;mdash;gave him a standing ovation before he sang one note&lt;ref name=Vegas1/&gt;. After a successful performance, he returned to give an encore, of &quot;Can't Help Falling in Love&quot;, and received his third standing ovation&lt;ref name=Vegas1/&gt;. Backstage, many celebrities and well-wishers, including [[Cary Grant]], congratulated Presley on his triumphant return which, in the showroom alone, had generated over $1,500,000 in revenues.&lt;ref name=Vegas1/&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'' commented: &quot;There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elvispeople.com/share.php Elvis Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt; Rolling Stone magazine declared Presley to be &quot;supernatural, his own resurrection&quot;, while [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] proclaimed him a &quot;superstar&quot;&lt;ref name=Clutton/&gt;. At a press conference after his opening show, when a reporter referred to him as &quot;The King&quot;, Presley pointed to Fats Domino, standing at the back of the room. &quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;that’s the real king of rock and roll.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cook-39&gt;Cook, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at a salary of $1 million per year.&lt;ref name=Vegas1/&gt;

===1970–1972===
[[Image:Elvis-nixon.jpg|thumb|left|Elvis meets [[U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[White House]] [[Oval Office]], December 21, 1970]]

In January 1970, Presley returned to the International Hotel for a month-long engagement, performing two shows a night. RCA recorded some shows and the best material appeared on the album [[On Stage: February 1970|''On Stage - February 1970'']].&lt;ref name=Stanley-94&gt;Stanley and Coffey, p.94&lt;/ref&gt; In late February, Presley performed six more attendance-breaking shows at the [[Houston Astrodome]] in [[Texas]].&lt;ref name=Stanley-95&gt;Stanley and Coffey, p.95&lt;/ref&gt;
In August at the International Hotel, MGM filmed rehearsal and concert footage for a documentary: [[Elvis: That's the Way It Is|''Elvis - That's The Way It Is'']]. He wore a jumpsuit&amp;mdash;a garment that would become a trademark of Presley's live performances in the 1970s. Although he had new hit singles in many countries, some were critical of his song choices and accused him of being distant from trends within contemporary music.&lt;ref&gt;(Aired: August 7, 2002). &quot;How Big Was The King? Elvis Presley's Legacy, 25 Years After His Death.&quot; ''CBS News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time Presley was threatened with kidnapping at the International Hotel. Phone calls were received, one demanding $50,000; if unpaid, Presley would be killed by a &quot;crazy man&quot;. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] took the threat seriously and security was stepped up for the next two shows. Presley went on stage with a [[Derringer]] in his right boot and a .45 in his waistband, but nothing untoward transpired.&lt;ref name=Hopkins-254&gt;Hopkins 2007, p.254&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanley-96&gt;Stanley and Coffey, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; (The singer had had many threats of varying degrees since the fifties, many of them made without the singer's knowledge).&lt;ref name=Hopkins-253&gt;Hopkins 2007, p.253&lt;/ref&gt;

After closing his Las Vegas engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on his first concert tour since 1958. Feeling exhausted, Presley spent a month relaxing and recording before touring again in October and November.&lt;ref name=Stanley-99&gt;Stanley and Coffey, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; He would tour extensively in the U.S. up to his death; many of the 1,145 concerts setting attendance records.

On December 21, 1970, Presley met with President [[Richard Nixon]] at the [[White House]] (Presley arrived with a gift&amp;mdash;a handgun. It was accepted but not presented for security reasons). Presley had engineered the encounter to express his patriotism, his contempt for the [[hippie]] [[drug culture]] and his wish to be appointed a &quot;Federal Agent at Large&quot;. He also wished to obtain a [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]] badge to add to similar items he had begun collecting. He offered to &quot;infiltrate hippie groups&quot; and claimed that [[The Beatles]] had &quot;made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guralnick-420&quot;&gt;Guralnick 1999, p.420&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon was uncertain and bemused by their encounter, and twice expressed concern that Presley needed to &quot;retain his credibility&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guralnick-420&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guralnick-passim&quot;&gt;Guralnick 1999, in passim&lt;/ref&gt; Ringo Starr later said he found it very sad to think Presley held such views. &quot;This is Mr. Hips, ''the man'', and he felt we were a danger. I think that the danger was mainly to him and his career.&quot; Paul McCartney said also that he &quot;felt a bit betrayed ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Roylance, ''The Beatles Anthology'', 2000, Chronicle Books. p.192
&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 1971 Presley was named 'One of the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Nation' by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce (The Jaycees). That summer, the City of Memphis named part of Highway 51 South &quot;Elvis Presley Boulevard&quot;, and he won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] (the organization that presents Grammy awards).

In April 1972, MGM again filmed Presley, this time for ''[[Elvis on Tour]]'', which won a 1972 Golden Globe for Best Documentary. A fourteen-date tour started with an unprecedented four consecutive sold-out shows at [[Madison Square Garden]], New York. RCA taped the shows for a live album. After the tour, Presley released the 1972 single &quot;[[Burning Love]]&quot;&amp;mdash;his last top ten hit in the U.S. charts.

===Divorce from Priscilla===
Off stage, Presley had continuing problems. His lifelong friend, [[Diamond Joe Esposito|Joe Esposito]], said Elvis &quot;could never be true to any one woman.&quot; It was widely known that Presley had several affairs during his 13-year union with Priscilla, notably with [[Ann-Margret]]. In spite of his own infidelity, Presley was furious that Priscilla was having an affair with a mutual acquaintance&amp;mdash;Mike Stone, a karate instructor she had met in 1971 backstage at one of Presley's concerts.&lt;ref name=Clutton/&gt; It was Presley himself who first suggested Priscilla should take lessons from Stone.&lt;ref name=Clutton/&gt; Once the news of their affair came to his attention, he raged obsessively: &quot;There's too much pain in me... Stone [must] die.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick 1999, p.489&lt;/ref&gt; A bodyguard, [[Red West]], felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when Presley decided: &quot;Aw hell... Maybe it's a bit heavy...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick 1999, p.490&lt;/ref&gt; The Presleys separated on February 23, 1972 and divorced on October 9, 1973, agreeing to share custody of their daughter.

Following his separation from Priscilla, he lived with [[Linda Thompson (actress)|Linda Thompson]], a songwriter and one-time Memphis [[beauty contest|beauty queen]], from July 1972 until just a few months before his death.&lt;ref name=Hopkins-291&gt;Hopkins 2007, p.291&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aloha from Hawaii===
[[Image:ElvisPresleyAlohafromHawaii.jpg|thumb|righy|Elvis Presley, in ''[[Aloha From Hawaii]]'' television broadcast via satellite on January 14, 1973]]
{{main|Aloha from Hawaii}}
In January 1973, Presley performed two charity concerts in Hawaii for the [[Kui Lee]] cancer foundation. The first (January 12) was primarily a practice run for the main show which was broadcast live on January 14 (The first show also served as a backup if technical problems affected the live broadcast). The &quot;[[Aloha from Hawaii]]&quot; concert was the world's first live concert satellite broadcast, reaching at least a billion viewers live and a further 500 million on delay. The show's album went to number one and spent a year in the charts.&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#Aloha_From_Hawaii Aloha From Hawaii]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The album also proved to be Presley's last U.S. Number One album during his lifetime.

===1973–1976===
After his divorce in 1973, Presley became increasingly isolated and overweight, with prescription drugs affecting his health, mood and his stage act. He overdosed twice on [[barbiturate]]s, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first.&lt;ref name=DrFeelgood&gt;(August 11, 2002). &quot;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,772041,00.html Elvis Special: Doctor Feelgood]&quot;. ''[[The Observer]]''. Reprinted in ''[[Guardian Unlimited]]''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-12]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. [[George C. Nichopoulos]], Presley's physician, the singer was &quot;near death&quot; in November of 1973 because of side effects of [[Demerol]] addiction. Nichopoulos notes that the hospital admission &quot;was crazy&quot;, because of the enormous attention Presley attracted, and the measures necessary to protect his medical details. Lab technicians were even exploiting Presley's ill-health by selling samples of his blood and urine.&lt;ref name=Clayton-293&gt;Clayton and Heard, p.293&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Elvis: The Final Years'', Jerry Hopkins writes: &quot;Elvis' health plummeted as his weight ballooned.&quot; At a University of [[Maryland]] concert on September 27 (1974), band members &quot;had trouble recognizing him. ... 'He walked on stage and held onto the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody was scared.' Guitarist John Wilkinson ... recalled, ... 'He was all gut. He was slurring. ... It was obvious he was drugged, that there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad, the words to the songs were barely intelligible. ... We were in a state of shock.' &quot;

Despite this, his &quot;thundering&quot; live version of &quot;[[How Great Thou Art (album)|How Great Thou Art]]&quot; won him a Grammy award in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, p.381.&lt;/ref&gt; Presley won three competitive &quot;Grammies&quot; for his [[gospel music|gospel]] recordings: &quot;How Great Thou Art&quot;&amp;mdash;the album, as well as the single&amp;mdash;and for the album ''[[He Touched Me]]'' (1972). (He had fourteen nominations during his career, though it has been claimed that &quot;Elvis has never been adequately appreciated by those who give the Grammies.&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Roy 1985, p.131.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1974, rumours began that he would actually be playing overseas after years of offers.&lt;ref name=Stanley-123&gt;Stanley and Coffey, p.123&lt;/ref&gt; A $1,000,000 bid came in from a source in Australia for him to tour there, but Colonel Parker was uncharacteristically reluctant to accept such large sums. This prompted those closest to Presley to speculate about Parker's past and circumstances, and the reasons for his apparent unwillingness to apply for a passport to travel abroad. He scotched any notions Presley had of overseas work by citing poor security in other countries, and the lack of suitable venues for a star of his status. Presley apparently accepted such excuses, at the time.&lt;ref name=Stanley-123 /&gt;

Presley continued to play to sell-out crowds in the U.S.; a 1975 tour ended with a concert in [[Pontiac, Michigan]], attended by over 62,000 fans. However the singer now had &quot;no motivation to lose his extra poundage... he became self-conscious... his self-confidence before the audience declined... Headlines such as 'Elvis Battles Middle Age' and 'Time Makes Listless Machine of Elvis' were not uncommon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roy, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marjorie Garber, when Presley made his later appearances in Las Vegas, he appeared &quot;heavier, in pancake make-up... with an elaborate jewelled belt and cape, crooning pop songs to a microphone ... [He] had become [[Liberace]]. Even his fans were now middle-aged matrons and blue-haired grandmothers, ... [[Mother's Day]] became a special holiday for Elvis' fans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Garber, ''Vested Interests: Cross-Dressing &amp; Cultural Anxiety'' (1992), p.380&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 1976, Presley's father fired &quot;Memphis Mafia&quot; bodyguards Red West, Sonny West and David Hebler. All three were taken by surprise, especially the Wests, who had been with Presley since the beginning of his career.&lt;ref name=Stanley-139&gt;Stanley and Coffey, p.139&lt;/ref&gt; Presley was away in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] when it happened, and some suggest the singer was too cowardly to face them himself.&lt;ref name=Hopkins-354&gt;Hopkins 2007, p.354&lt;/ref&gt; Vernon Presley cited the need to &quot;cut back on expenses&quot; when dismissing the three, but David Stanley has claimed that the real reason was that the bodyguards were becoming more outspoken over Presley's drug dependency.&lt;ref name=Stanley-140&gt;Stanley and Coffey, p.140&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;trusted associate&quot; of Presley, John O'Grady, also stated, in agreement with Parker and Vernon Presley, that the bodyguards &quot;were too rough with the fans... resulting in a lot of unnecessary lawsuits&quot; and lawyers' fees.&lt;ref name=Hopkins-354 /&gt; The Wests and Hebler would later write a devastating indictment of Presley in the book: ''[[Steve Dunleavy|Elvis: What Happened?]]'', published August 1, 1977.&lt;ref name=Stanley-148&gt;Stanley and Coffey, p.148&lt;/ref&gt; (See: '[[#Final year and death|Final year and death]]').

Almost throughout the 1970s, RCA Victor had been increasingly concerned about making money from Presley material: they often had to rely on live recordings because of problems getting him to attend studio sessions. RCA Victor's mobile studio was occasionally sent to ''Graceland'' in the hope of capturing an inspired vocal performance. Once in a studio, he could lack interest or be easily distracted; often this was linked to his health and drug problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guralnick-passim&quot;/&gt;

===Final year and death===
In 2006, a journalist recalled: &quot;Elvis Presley had [in 1977] become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self... he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Scherman, T. (August 16, 2006). &quot;Elvis Dies&quot;. ''American Heritage''.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], the singer was on stage for less than an hour and &quot;was impossible to understand.&quot;&lt;ref name=Guralnick-628&gt;Guralnick 1999, p.628&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Baton Rouge]], Presley failed to appear: he was unable to get out of his hotel bed, and the rest of the tour was cancelled.&lt;ref name=Guralnick-628/&gt;
In [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] on May 20, &quot;there was no longer any pretense of keeping up appearances. The idea was simply to get Elvis out on stage and keep him upright...&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;tefeqq&quot;/&gt; Despite his obvious problems, shows in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] and [[Rapid City, South Dakota]] were recorded for an album and a CBS-TV special: ''[[Elvis In Concert]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;Guralnick 1999, pp.637-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rapid City, &quot;he was so nervous on stage that he could hardly talk... He was undoubtedly painfully aware of how he looked, and he knew that in his condition, he could not perform any significant movement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roy, ''Elvis: Prophet of Power'', p.71.&lt;/ref&gt; His performance in Omaha &quot;exceeded everyone's worst fears... [giving] the impression of a man crying out for help...&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; According to Guralnick, fans &quot;were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past Elvis, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his [spiritualism] books.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;tefeqq&quot;&gt;Guralnick 1999, p.634&lt;/ref&gt; A cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how Presley would sit in his room and chat, recounting things like his favorite [[Monty Python]] sketches and his own past japes, but &quot;mostly there was a grim obsessiveness... a paranoia about people, germs... future events&quot;, that reminded Smith of [[Howard Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick 1999, p.212 and 642&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''[[Steve Dunleavy|Elvis: What Happened?]]'' was published just fifteen days before Presley's death. It was the first exposé to detail Presley's years of drug misuse, and was apparently the authors' revenge for them being sacked and also a plea to get Presley to recognize the extent of his drug problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elvispresleynews.com/ElvisAutopsy.html Review of Medical Report].

Presley's final performance was in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] at the [[Market Square Arena]], on June 26, 1977. According to many of his entourage who accompanied him on tour, it was the &quot;best show he had given in a long time&quot; with &quot;some strong singing&quot;&lt;ref name=Clutton/&gt;.

Another tour was scheduled to begin August 17, 1977, but at ''Graceland'' the day before, Presley was found on his bathroom floor by fiancée, [[Ginger Alden]]. According to the medical investigator, Presley had &quot;stumbled or crawled several feet before he died&quot;; he had apparently been using the toilet at the time.&lt;ref name=Guralnick-1999-651&gt;Guralnick 1999, p.651&lt;/ref&gt; Death was officially pronounced at 3:30 pm at the Baptist Memorial Hospital.

Before his funeral, hundreds of thousands of fans, the press and celebrities lined the streets and many hoped to see the open casket in ''Graceland''. One of Presley's cousins, Bobby Mann&lt;ref name=Clutton/&gt;, accepted $18,000 to secretly photograph the corpse; the picture duly appeared on the cover of the [[National Enquirer]], making it the largest and fastest selling issue of all time.&lt;ref name=Hopkins-386&gt;Hopkins 2007, p.386&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after the singer's death, a car ploughed into a group of 2000 fans outside Presley's home, killing two women and critically injuring a third.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew-Walker 1979, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Among the mourners at the funeral were Ann-Margret (who had remained close to Presley) and his ex-wife.&lt;ref name=Clayton-394&gt;Clayton and Heard, p.394.&lt;/ref&gt; [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] issued a statement (See '[[#Legacy|Legacy]]').&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, John T.; Gerhard Peters. &quot;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=7969 Jimmy Carter: Death of Elvis Presley Statement by the President]&quot;.

On Thursday, August 18, following a funeral service at ''Graceland'',&lt;ref name=Clutton/&gt; Elvis Presley was buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis, next to his mother. After an attempt to steal the body on August 28,&lt;ref name=Clutton/&gt; and with no sign of security concerns at Forest Hills abating,&lt;ref name=Clutton/&gt; his&amp;mdash;and his mother's&amp;mdash;remains were reburied at ''Graceland'' in the Meditation Garden in October.&lt;ref name=Clutton/&gt;

Presley had developed many health problems during his life, some of them chronic.&lt;ref&gt;Baden and Hennessee, p.35 &quot;Elvis had an enlarged heart for a long time. That, together with his drug habit, caused his death. But he was difficult to diagnose; it was a judgment call.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He started taking drugs ([[amphetamines]]) regularly in the army; it has also been claimed that pills of some form were first given to him by Memphis DJ [[Dewey Phillips]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Albert, ''Elvis: The Last 24 Hours,'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Priscilla Presley writes that by 1962, he was taking [[placidyl]]s to combat severe [[insomnia]] in ever-increasing doses and later took [[Dexedrine]] to counter the sleeping pills' after-effects. She later saw &quot;problems in Elvis' life, all magnified by taking prescribed drugs.&quot; Presley's physician, Dr. Nichopoulos, has said: &quot;[Elvis] felt that by getting [pills] from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday junkie getting something off the street. He... thought that as far as medications and drugs went, there was something for everything.&quot;&lt;ref name=DrFeelgood/&gt;

According to Guralnick: &quot;[D]rug use was heavily implicated... no one ruled out the possibility of [[anaphylactic shock]] brought on by the [[codeine]] pills... to which he was known to have had a mild allergy.&quot; In two lab reports filed two months later, each indicated &quot;a strong belief that the primary cause of death was [[polypharmacy]],&quot; with one report &quot;indicating the detection of fourteen drugs in Elvis' system, ten in significant quantity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick, p.652&lt;/ref&gt; It appears he died of [[Combined Drug Intoxication]].

The medical profession has been seriously questioned. [[Coroner|Medical Examiner]] Dr. Jerry Francisco had publicly offered a cause of death while the autopsy was still being performed, but before toxicology results were known. Dr. Francisco dubiously stated that [[cardiac arrhythmia]] was the cause of death, a condition that can only be determined in a living person&amp;mdash;not post mortem.&lt;ref name=CourtTV&gt;&quot;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/forensics/cyril_wecht/4.html Coverup for a King]&quot;. ''[[Court TV]] Crime Library''. Retrieved [[2007-10-12]].&lt;/ref&gt; Many doctors had been flattered to be associated with Presley (or had been bribed with gifts) and supplied him with pills, which simply fed his addictions.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton and Heard, p.336&lt;/ref&gt; The singer allegedly spent at least $1 million annually during his latter years on drugs and doctors' fees or inducements.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Albert, ''Elvis: The Last 24 Hours,'' p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dr. Nichopoulos was exonerated with regard to Presley's death, &quot;In the first eight months of 1977 alone, he had [prescribed] more than 10,000 doses of sedatives, amphetamines, and narcotics: all in Elvis' name. On January 20, 1980, the board found [against] him... but decided that he was not unethical [because he claimed he'd been trying to wean the singer off the drugs].&quot; His license was suspended. In July 1995, it was permanently revoked after it was found he had improperly dispensed drugs to several patients including [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].&lt;ref name=DrFeelgood/&gt;

In 1994, the autopsy into Presley's death was re-opened. Coroner Dr. Joseph Davis declared: &quot;There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs [i.e. [[drug overdose]]]. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent [[heart attack]].&quot;&lt;ref name=DrFeelgood/&gt; However, there is little doubt that long-term drug abuse caused his premature death.&lt;ref name=CourtTV/&gt;

Biographer Ernst Jorgensen has observed that when Presley died, it was as if all perspective on his musical career had been lost.&lt;ref name = &quot;hlogiw&quot;&gt;Jorgensen, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; His latter-day song choices had been seen as poor; many who disliked Presley had long been dismissive because he did not write his own songs.

Presley has featured prominently in a variety of polls and surveys designed to measure popularity and influence.{{fn|g}} However, sociologist Philip Ennis writes: &quot;Perhaps it is an error of enthusiasm to freight Elvis Presley with too heavy a historical load&quot; because, according to a opinion poll of high school students in 1957, [[Pat Boone]] was nearly the &quot;two-to-one favorite over Elvis Presley among boys and preferred almost three-to-one by girls...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See Ennis, Philip H., ''The Seventh Stream: The Emergence of Rocknroll in American Popular Music'' (Wesleyan University Press, 1992), pp.251-252.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Presley's early music and live performances are credited with helping to lay a commercial foundation which allowed established [[African American]] acts of the 1950s to receive due recognition. Performers like [[Fats Domino]], [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]], came to national prominence after Presley's mix of musical styles was accepted among [[White American]] teenagers.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP&quot; /&gt; Rather than Presley being seen as a white man who 'stole black music', Little Richard argued: &quot;He was an integrator, Elvis was a blessing.

In the late 1960s, composer and conductor [[Leonard Bernstein]] remarked: &quot;Elvis is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century.

Presley's recorded voice is seen by many as his enduring legacy. Music critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] writes: &quot;Elvis Presley has been described variously as a baritone and a tenor. An extraordinary compass... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion. The voice covers two octaves and a third ... Moreover, he has not been confined to one type of vocal production. In ballads and country songs he belts out full-voiced high G's and A's that an opera baritone might envy. He is a naturally assimilative stylist with a multiplicity of voices&amp;mdash;in fact, Elvis' is an extraordinary voice, or many voices.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wikiquote&gt;[[q:Elvis Presley|WikiQuote: Elvis Presley]]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been noted that &quot;Presley’s comprehensive musical knowledge and talent also surprised and impressed [[songwriters]] [[Jerry Leiber]] and [[Mike Stoller]]... [They] considered Presley to be an '[[idiot savant]]' because he knew so many songs. His knowledge of the blues especially impressed them. Leiber remembers that Presley &quot;could imitate anything he heard. He had a perfect ear,&quot;... Presley could sing and/or play a song on the piano after hearing it only once or twice. His natural ear for music, ability to play by ear, and to improvise were well known to his friends and musical associates.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cook-20 /&gt;

Gospel tenor Shawn Nielsen, who sang backing vocals for Presley on tour, said: &quot;He could sing anything. I've never seen such versatility... He had such great soul. He had the ability to make everyone in the audience think that he was singing directly to them. He just had a way with communication that was totally unique.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wikiquote /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Khurana&quot;/&gt;

Paul F. Campos has written: &quot;The Elvis cult touches on so many crucial nerves of American popular culture: the ascent of a workingclass boy from the most obscure backwater to international fame and fortune; the white man with the soul of black music in his voice; the performer whose music tied together the main strands of American folk music – country, rhythm and blues, and gospel; and, perhaps most compellingly for a weight-obsessed nation, the sexiest man in America's gradual transformation into a fat, sweating parody of his former self, straining the bounds of a jewel-encrusted bodysuit on a Las Vegas stage. The images of fat Elvis and thin Elvis live together in the popular imagination.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Paul F., ''The Obesity Myth: Why America's Obsession with Weight is Hazardous to Your Health'' (2004), p.81.&lt;/ref&gt; The singer continues to be imitated&amp;mdash;and parodied&amp;mdash;outside the main music industry and Presley songs remain very popular on the [[karaoke]] circuit. People from a diversity of cultures and backgrounds work as [[Elvis impersonator]]s (&quot;the raw 1950s Elvis and the kitschy 1970s Elvis are the favorites.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stecopoulos, p.198&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 2002, it was observed: {{quotation|For those too young to have experienced Elvis Presley in his prime, today’s celebration of the 25th anniversary of his death must seem peculiar. All the talentless impersonators and appalling black velvet paintings on display can make him seem little more than a perverse and distant memory. But before Elvis was camp, he was its opposite: a genuine cultural force... Elvis’s breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely.|''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;(August 16, 2002). &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE0DD143DF935A2575BC0A9649C8B63 Long Live the King]&quot;.

* {{fnb|a}} Presley's genuine birth certificate reads &quot;Elvis ''Aaron'' Presley&quot; (as written by a doctor). There is also a souvenir birth certificate that reads &quot;Elvis ''Aron'' Presley.&quot; When Presley did sign his middle name, he used Aron. It reads 'Aron' on his marriage certificate and on his army duffel bag. Aron was apparently the spelling the Presleys used to make it similar to the middle name of Elvis' stillborn twin, Jesse ''Garon''. Elvis later sought to change the name's spelling to the traditional and biblical Aaron. In the process he learned that &quot;official state records had always listed it as Aaron. Therefore, he always was, officially, Elvis Aaron Presley.&quot; Knowing Presley's plans for his middle name, Aaron is the spelling his father chose for Elvis' tombstone, and it is the spelling his estate has designated as the official spelling whenever the middle name is used today. His death certificate says &quot;Elvis Aron Presley.&quot; This quirk has helped inflame the &quot;[[Elvis sightings|Elvis is not dead]]&quot; conspiracy theories.&lt;ref name=Aaron /&gt;

Instructor Rick Husky says: &quot;...Basically [our meeting] never went anywhere... Elvis got up and did some demonstrations with Ed [Parker], you know stumbled around a little bit, and it was very sad.&quot; Husky was aware that Presley was &quot;stoned.&quot; &quot;Colonel&quot; Parker thought the project was folly&amp;mdash;and a drain on their resources&amp;mdash;from the start. (Guralnick 1994, p.531 and in passim).

'''Albert Camus''' ({{IPA-fr|albɛʁ kamy}}) (7 November 1913 – 4 January 1960) was an [[Algeria]]n-born [[France|French]] [[author]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]], and journalist who won the [[Nobel prize]] in 1957. He is often associated with [[existentialism]], but Camus refused this label. On the other hand, as he wrote in his essay ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'', his whole life was devoted to opposing the philosophy of [[nihilism]]. On the subject of his [[Existence of God|belief or not]] in [[God]], he writes in the third volume of his notebooks: &quot;I do not believe in God ''and'' I am not an [[Atheism|atheist]].&quot;

In 1949, Camus founded the Group for International Liaisons in the [[Revolutionary Union Movement]], according to the book ''Albert Camus, une vie'' by Olivier Todd, a group opposed to the atheist and communistic tendencies of the surrealistic movement of [[André Breton]]. Camus was the second-youngest recipient of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] (after [[Rudyard Kipling]]) when he became the first African-born writer to receive the award, in 1957. He is also the shortest-lived of any literature laureate to date, having died in an automobile accident only three years after receiving the award.

Camus preferred to be known as a man and a thinker, rather than as a member of a school or ideology. He preferred persons over ideas. In an interview in 1945, Camus rejected any ideological associations: &quot;No, I am not an existentialist. [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]] and I are always surprised to see our names linked…&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Les Nouvelles litteraires'', 15 November 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years== 
Albert Camus was born on 7 November 1913 in [[Dréan|Mondovi]], [[Algeria]] to a French-Algerian ([[pied-noir]]) settler family. His mother was of Spanish extraction and was half-deaf. His father, Lucien, died in the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in 1914 during the [[World War I|First World War]], while serving as a member of the [[Zouave]] infantry regiment. Camus lived in poor conditions during his childhood in the Belcourt section of [[Algiers]]. In 1923, he was accepted into the [[lycée]] and eventually to the [[University of Algiers]]. However, he contracted [[tuberculosis]] in 1930, which put an end to his [[Association football|football]] activities (he had been a [[goalkeeper]] for the university team) and forced him to make his studies a part-time pursuit. He took odd jobs including private tutor, car parts clerk and work for the Meteorological Institute. He completed his ''licence de philosophie'' ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) in 1935; in May 1936, he successfully presented his thesis on [[Plotinus]], ''Néo-Platonisme et Pensée Chrétienne'', for his ''diplôme d'études supérieures'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] by thesis). {{French literature (small)}}

Camus joined the [[French Communist Party]] in the Spring of 1935 seeing it as a way to &quot;fight inequalities between Europeans and 'natives' in Algeria&quot;, he did not suggest he was a Marxist or that he had read ''Das Kapital'', but did write that &quot;[w]e might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Todd&quot;&gt;Todd, O ''Albert Camus: A Life'', p37, 250, Alfred A. Knopf, 1998; Carroll &amp; Graf, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the independence-minded [[Algerian Communist Party]] (PCA) was founded. Camus joined the activities of the [[Algerian People's Party]] (''Le Parti du Peuple Algérien''), which got him into trouble with his Communist party comrades. As a result, he was denounced as a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]] and expelled from the party in 1937. Camus went on to be associated with the French [[Anarchism|anarchist]] movement. The anarchist [[Andre Prudhommeaux]] first introduced him at a meeting in 1948 of the Cercle des Etudiants Anarchistes (Anarchist Student Circle) as a sympathiser who was familiar with anarchist thought. Camus went on to write for anarchist publications such as [[Le Libertaire]], ''La révolution Proletarienne'' and ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (periodical)|Solidaridad Obrera]]'' (the organ of the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]). Camus also stood with the anarchists when they expressed support for the [[uprising of 1953 in East Germany]]. He again stood with the anarchists in 1956, first with the workers’ uprising in [[Poznan]], [[Poland]], and then later in the year with the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]]. 

In 1934, he married Simone Hie, a [[morphine]] addict, but the marriage ended as a consequence of infidelities on both sides. In 1935, he founded ''Théâtre du Travail'' — &quot;Worker's Theatre&quot; — (renamed ''Théâtre de l'Equipe'' (&quot;Team's Theatre&quot;) in 1937), which survived until 1939. From 1937 to 1939 he wrote for a [[socialist]] paper, ''Alger-Républicain'', and his work included an account of the peasants who lived in [[Kabylie]] in poor conditions, which apparently cost him his job. From 1939 to 1940, he briefly wrote for a similar paper, ''Soir-Republicain''. He was rejected by the French army because of his tuberculosis.

In 1940, Camus married [[Francine Faure]], a pianist and mathematician. Although he loved Francine, he had argued passionately against the institution of marriage, dismissing it as unnatural. Even after Francine gave birth to twins, Catherine and Jean, on 5 September 1945, he continued to joke wearily to friends that he was not cut out for marriage. Camus conducted numerous affairs, particularly an irregular and eventually public affair with the Spanish-born actress [[Maria Casares]]. In the same year Camus began to work for ''[[Paris-Soir]]'' magazine. In the first stage of [[World War II]], the so-called [[Phony War]] stage, Camus was a [[pacifism|pacifist]]. However, he was in [[Paris]] to witness how the [[Wehrmacht]] took over. On 15 December 1941, Camus witnessed the execution of [[Gabriel Péri]], an event that Camus later said crystallized his revolt against the Germans. Afterwards he moved to [[Bordeaux]] alongside the rest of the staff of ''Paris-Soir''. In the same year he finished his first books, ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. He returned briefly to [[Oran]], Algeria in 1942.

== Literary career ==
During the war Camus joined the [[French Resistance]] cell ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the [[pseudonym|nom de guerre]] &quot;Beauchard&quot;. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943, and when the Allies liberated Paris, Camus reported on the last of the fighting. He was, however, one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition to the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima]] soon after the event on 8 August 1945. He eventually resigned from ''Combat'' in 1947, when it became a commercial paper. It was then that Camus became acquainted with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

After the war, Camus began frequenting the [[Café de Flore]] on the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]] in [[Paris]] with Sartre and others. Camus also toured the [[United States]] to lecture about French thinking. Although he leaned [[left-wing politics|left]] politically, his strong criticisms of [[Communism|Communist]] doctrine did not win him any friends in the [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] and eventually also alienated Sartre. 

In 1949 his tuberculosis returned and he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951 he published ''[[The Rebel]]'', a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which made clear his rejection of communism. The book upset many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France and led to the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed him and he began instead to translate plays.

Camus' first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd, the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he explained in ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' and incorporated into many of his other works, such as ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Plague]]''. Despite the split from his &quot;study partner,&quot; Sartre, some still argue that Camus falls into the [[existentialist]] camp.  However, he rejected that label himself in his essay ''Enigma'' and elsewhere (see: ''The Lyrical and Critical Essays of Albert Camus'').  The current confusion may still arise as many recent applications of existentialism have much in common with many of Camus' ''practical'' ideas (see: ''Resistance, Rebellion, and Death'').  However, the personal understanding he had of the world (e.g. &quot;a benign indifference&quot;, in ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]''), and every vision he had for its progress (i.e. vanquishing the &quot;adolescent furies&quot; of history and society, in ''[[The Rebel]]'') undoubtedly sets him apart.

In the 1950s Camus devoted his efforts to [[human rights]]. In 1952 he resigned from his work for [[UNESCO]] when the [[UN]] accepted [[Spain]] as a member under the leadership of [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]. In 1953 he criticized [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] methods to crush a workers' strike in [[East Berlin]]. In 1956 he protested against similar methods in [[Poland]] (protests in [[Poznań]]) and the Soviet repression of the Hungarian revolution in October. 

[[Image:Camus Monument in Villeblevin France 17-august-2003.1.JPG|thumb|The monument to Camus built in the small town of [[Villeblevin]], France where he died in an automobile accident on 4 January 1960]]

He maintained his pacifism and resistance to [[capital punishment]] anywhere in the world. One of his most significant contributions to the movement against capital punishment was an essay collaboration with [[Arthur Koestler]], the writer, intellectual and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment.

[[Image:Camus Monument in Villeblevin France 17-august-2003.4.JPG|thumb|left|The bronze plaque on the monument to Camus, built in the small town of [[Villeblevin]], France. The plaque reads: &quot;From the Yonne area's local council, in tribute to the writer Albert Camus who was watched over in the Villeblevin town hall in the night of 4 January – 5 January 1960.&quot;]]

When the [[Algerian War]] began in 1954 it presented a moral dilemma for Camus. He identified with [[pied-noir]]s, and defended the French government on the grounds that the revolt in Algeria was really an integral part of the 'new Arab imperialism' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States'.&lt;ref&gt;''Actuelles III: Chroniques Algeriennes'', 1939–58&lt;/ref&gt; Although favouring greater Algerian [[self-governance|autonomy]] or even [[federation]], though not full-scale independence, he believed that the pied-noirs and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty. 

From 1955 to 1956 Camus wrote for ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]''. In 1957 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in literature]] &quot;for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times.&quot;, officially not for his novel ''[[The Fall (novel)|The Fall]]'', published the previous year, but for his writings against capital punishment in the essay ''Réflexions sur la Guillotine''. When he spoke to students at the [[University of Stockholm]], he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question and stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother, who still lived in Algeria. This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals.

==The Revolutionary Union Movement and the European Union==
In 1949 Camus founded the Group for International Liaisons in the [[Revolutionary Union Movement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Todd&quot; /&gt; With [[George Orwell]], he opposed totalitarian regimes in the East and the West.

As he wrote in ''L'Homme révolté'' (in the chapter about &quot;The Thought on Midday&quot;) he was a follower of the ancient Greek 'Solar Tradition' (la ''pensée solaire''). So, not only he was the leader of the French resistance movement &quot;Combat&quot; but he also set up in 1947-8 the [[Revolutionary Union Movement]] ([[Groupes de liaison internationale]] - [[GLI]]) which was formed in 1949 and can be described as a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary syndicalism ([[Syndicalisme révolutionnaire]]). For more, see the book : ''Alfred Rosmer et le mouvement révolutionnaire internationale'' by Christian Gras).

His colleagues were [[Nicolas Lazarévitch]], [[Louis Mercier]], [[Roger Lapeyre]], [[Paul Chauvet]], [[Auguste Largentier]], [[Jean de Boë]] (see the article: &quot;Nicolas Lazarévitch, Itinéraire d'un syndicaliste révolutionnaire&quot; by Sylvain Boulouque in the review Communisme, n° 61, 2000). His main aim was to express the positive side of Surrealism and Existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the nihilism of [[André Breton]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

In 1944 Camus founded the &quot;French Committee for the European Federation&quot; (Comité Français pour la Féderation Européene -CFFE) declaring that Europe &quot;can only evolve along the path of economic progress, democracy and peace if the nation states become a federation&quot;.

From 1943, Albert Camus had correspondence with [[Altiero Spinelli]] who founded the [[European Federalist Movement]] in Milan (see [[Ventotene Manifesto]] and the book &quot;Unire l'Europa, superare gli stati&quot;, Altiero Spinelli nel Partito d'Azione del Nord Italia e in Francia dal 1944 al 1945-annexed a letter by Altiero Spinelli to Albert Camus).

In 22-25 March 1945, the first conference of the [[European Federalist Movement]] was organised in Paris with the  participation of Albert Camus, George Orwell, [[Emmanuel Mounier]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[André Philip]], [[Daniel Mayer]], [[François Bondy]] and [[Altiero Spinelli]] (see the book &quot;The Biography of Europe&quot; by Pan Drakopoulos). This specific branch of the [[European Federalist Movement]] disintegrated in 1957 after the domination of [[Winston Churchill]]'s ideas about the European integration.

==Camus and Orwell==

Three essays by Dr. [[Miho Takashima]] in the ''International Journal of Humanities'' (&quot;Revolt and Equilibrium: A Comparative Study of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and ''[[L'Homme Révolté]]'', the Views and Struggles of Orwell and Camus&quot;, &quot;Art and Representation: A Comparative Study of George Orwell and Albert Camus on their Literary Works&quot;, and &quot;George Orwell and Albert Camus: A Comparative Study – Their Views and Dilemmas in the Politics of the 1930s and 40s&quot;) explore the relation between the work of the French writer Albert Camus and the English writer [[George Orwell]].

Takashima argues that Orwell—perhaps intentionally, in order to warn the intellectual elite—compromised with &quot;[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]&quot;, while Camus confronted with ''[[The Plague]]''. This is observed not only in the comparison between ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and ''The Rebel'' but, especially, in Camus' play ''[[The State of Siege]]''.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} This theatrical play was written together with the novel ''The Plague'' and the essay ''The Rebel''. It is the work which—according to Camus himself{{Fact|date=March 2008}}—represents him best and is a response to George Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''. The hero, Diego, opposes the totalitarian dictator named Plague, and dies in order to set a Spanish town free from [[Spanish Inquisition|the Inquisition]].

''The State of Siege'' is a work against totalitarianism, written in the same epoch when Camus' idol,{{Fact|date=March 2008}} George Orwell, wrote ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''. The play includes an allegorical reference to the end of Orwell's novel.

The original title of ''The State of Siege'' was ''The Holy Inquisition in Cadix''.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} In the French edition of the book, Camus has included an essay under the title &quot;Why Spain?&quot;. In this polemical text, he answers his Catholic friend [[Gabriel Marcel]] who criticized him for setting the plot in Spain. Here Camus expresses his opposition to the totalitarian regimes of the West, and to the behavior of [[History of the Roman Catholic Church#20th century|the Vatican]] and [[Pope Pius XII|the Pope]] during World War II. The most important phrase of this essay is &quot;Why [[Bombing of Guernica|Guernica]], Gabriel Marcel?&quot;.

==Albert Camus' Death==

Camus died on 4 January 1960 in an automobile accident near [[Sens]], in a place named &quot;Le Grand Fossard&quot; in the small town of Villeblevin. In his coat pocket lay an unused train ticket. It is possible that he had planned to travel by train, but decided to go by car instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raimes.com/seminar.htm KIAD MA in Fine Art: a student run seminar&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:20041113-002 Lourmarin Tombstone Albert Camus.jpg|thumb|Albert Camus' gravestone]]
The driver of the [[Facel Vega]] car, [[Michel Gallimard]] —  his publisher and close friend — also perished in the accident. Camus was interred in the Lourmarin Cemetery, [[Lourmarin]], [[Vaucluse]], [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]], [[France]]. 

He was survived by his twin children, Catherine and Jean, who hold the copyrights to his work.

After his death, two of Camus' works were published posthumously. The first, entitled ''[[A Happy Death]]'' published in 1970, featured a character named Meursault, as in ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'', but there is some debate as to the relationship between the two stories. The second posthumous publication was an unfinished novel, ''[[The First Man]]'', that Camus was writing before he died. The novel was an [[autobiographical]] work about his childhood in [[Algeria]] and was published in 1995.

==Summary of Absurdism==
Many writers have written on the Absurd, each with his or her own interpretation of what the Absurd actually is and their own ideas on the importance of the Absurd. For example, [[Sartre]] recognizes the absurdity of individual experience, while [[Kierkegaard]] explains that the absurdity of certain religious truths prevent us from reaching God rationally. Camus was not the originator of [[Absurdism]] and regretted the continued reference to him as a ''philosopher of the absurd''. He shows less and less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing [[The Myth of Sisyphus|''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''The Myth of Sisyphus'')]]. To distinguish Camus' ideas of the Absurd from those of other philosophers, people sometimes refer to the '''Paradox of the Absurd''', when referring to ''Camus' Absurd''.

His early thoughts on the Absurd appeared in his first collection of essays, ''L'Envers et l'endroit'' (''The Two Sides Of The Coin'') in 1937. Absurd themes appeared with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, ''Noces'' (''Nuptials''), in 1938. In these essays Camus does not offer a philosophical account of the Absurd, or even a definition; rather he reflects on the experience of the Absurd. In 1942 he published the story of a man living an Absurd life as [[The Stranger (novel)|''L'Étranger'' (''The Stranger'')]], and in the same year released [[The Myth of Sisyphus|''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''The Myth of Sisyphus'')]], a literary essay on the Absurd. He had also written a play about a Roman Emperor, [[Caligula]], pursuing an Absurd logic. However, the play was not performed until 1945. The turning point in Camus' attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend, written between July 1943 and July 1944. The first was published in the ''Revue Libre'' in 1943, the second in the ''Cahiers de Libération'' in 1944, and the third in the newspaper ''Libertés'', in 1945. All four letters have been published as ''Lettres à un ami allemand'' (''Letters to a German Friend'') in 1945, and have appeared in the collection ''[[Resistance, Rebellion, and Death]]''.

==Camus' ideas on the Absurd==
In his essays Camus presented the reader with dualisms: happiness and sadness, dark and light, life and death, etc. His aim was to emphasize the fact that happiness is fleeting and that the human condition is one of mortality. He did this not to be morbid, but to reflect a greater appreciation for life and happiness. In ''Le Mythe'', this dualism becomes a paradox: We value our lives and existence so greatly, but at the same time we know we will eventually die, and ultimately our endeavours are meaningless. While we can live with a dualism (''I can accept periods of unhappiness, because I know I will also experience happiness to come''), we cannot live with the paradox (''I think my life is of great importance, but I also think it is meaningless''). In ''Le Mythe'', Camus was interested in how we experience the Absurd and how we live with it. Our life must have meaning for us to value it. If we accept that life has no meaning and therefore no value, should we kill ourselves?

Meursault, the Absurdist hero of ''L'Étranger,'' is a murderer who is executed for his crime. Caligula ends up admitting his Absurd logic was wrong and is killed by an assassination he has deliberately brought about. However, while Camus possibly suggests that Caligula's Absurd reasoning is wrong, the play's anti-hero does get the last word, as the author similarly exalts Meursault's final moments.

Camus' understanding of the Absurd promotes public debate; his various offerings entice us to think about the Absurd and offer our own contribution. Concepts such as cooperation, joint effort and solidarity are of key importance to Camus. 

Camus made a significant contribution to a viewpoint of the Absurd, and always rejected [[nihilism]] as a valid response. &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;If nothing had any meaning, you would be right. But there is something that still has a meaning.&quot; ''Second Letter to a German Friend'', December 1943.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What still had meaning for Camus is that despite humans being subjects in an indifferent and &quot;[[absurdism|absurd]]&quot; universe, in which meaning is challenged by the fact that we all die, meaning can be created, however provisionally and unstably, by our own decisions and interpretations.

==Opposition to totalitarianism==
Throughout his life, Camus spoke out against and actively opposed totalitarianism in its many forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spikemagazine.com/0397camu.php Interview with Catherine Camus]&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, Camus was active within the [[French Resistance]] to the German occupation of France during World War II, even directing the famous Resistance journal, ''Combat''. On the French collaboration with [[Nazi]] occupiers he wrote:
:Now the only moral value is courage, which is useful here for judging the puppets and chatterboxes who pretend to speak in the name of the people &lt;ref&gt;http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:becLSqP2AvMJ:query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html%3Fres%3D9806EED9113FF93AA25751C1A961958260%26sec%3D%26spon%3D%26pagewanted%3Dall+Now+the+only+moral+value+is+courage,+which+is+useful+here+for+judging+the+puppets+and+chatterboxes&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=uk In Camus' notebooks and letters, as quoted in ''Albert Camus
A Life'' By Olivier Todd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Camus' well-known falling out with Sartre is linked to this opposition to [[totalitarianism]]. Camus detected a reflexive [[totalitarianism]] in the [[mass politics]] espoused by [[Sartre]] in the name of radical [[Marxism]]. This was apparent in his work ''L'Homme Révolté'' (''The Rebel'') which not only was an assault on the Soviet police state, but also questioned the very nature of mass revolutionary politics. Camus continued to speak out against the atrocities of the [[Soviet Union]], a sentiment captured in his 1957 speech, ''[[The Blood of the Hungarians]]'', commemorating the anniversary of the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], an uprising crushed in a bloody assault by the Red Army.

==Camus and solidarity==
{{Cleanup-section|date=March 2008}}
=== Solidarity in ''The Stranger'' ===
In ''The Stranger'', Albert Camus characterizes his justification of the absurd through the experiences of a protagonist who simply does not conform to the system. His inherent honesty disturbs the status quo; Meursault's inability to lie cannot seamlessly integrate him within society and in turn threatens the simple fabrics of human mannerisms expected of a structurally ordered society. Consequently, the punishment for his crime is not decided on the basis of murder, but rather for the startling indifference towards his mother's recent death. Even after a conflicting spiritual discussion with a pastor inciting Meursault to consider a possible path towards redemption, the latter still refuses to take upon salvation and symbolizes his ultimatum by embracing the &quot;gentle indifference of the world&quot;; an act which only furthers his solidarity with a society incapable of realizing his seemingly inhumane and misanthropic behavior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

=== Solidarity in ''The Plague'' ===
The plague is an undeniable part of life. As posited in ''The Plague'', it is omnipresent, just like death was always an impeding factor in ''The Stranger''. Albert Camus once again questions the meaning of the moral concepts justifying humanity and human suffering within a religious framework. For Camus, the rationale behind Christian doctrine is useless; as mortal beings, we cannot successfully rationalize the impending and inescapable death sentence forced upon every human. The plague, which befalls upon Oran, is a concrete and tangible facilitator of death. Ultimately, the plague enables people to understand that their individual suffering is meaningless. As the epidemic &quot;evolves&quot; within the seasons, so do the citizens of Oran, who instead of willfully giving up to a disease they have no control over, decide to fight against their impending death, thus unwillingly creating optimism in the midst of hopelessness. This is where Camus channels his thoughts behind the importance of solidarity: although the plague is still primarily an agent of death, it provides the uncanny opportunity for people to realize that individual suffering is absurd. In the midst of complete suffering, the challenging response adopted by the majority of the citizens of Oran demonstrates an inexplicable humanistic connection between distraught and distant characters. Only by taking the choice to fight an irreversible epidemic are people able to create the ever-lacking meaning to a life destined for execution the moment of its creation.

==Camus and football==

Camus was once asked by his friend Charles Poncet which he preferred, football or the theatre. Camus is said to have replied, &quot;Football, without hesitation.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;rhybma&quot;&gt;[http://www.camus-society.com/camus-football.htm Albert Camus and football&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Camus played as goalkeeper for Racing Universitaire Algerios (RUA won both the [[North African Champions Cup]] and the [[North African Cup]] twice each in the 1930s) junior team from 1928–30.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redhotpawn.com/board/showthread.php?threadid=2803 RedHotPawn.com : General : Yan!! Camus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of team spirit, fraternity, and common purpose appealed to Camus enormously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.users.muohio.edu/shermalw/honors_2001_fall/honors_papers_2000/lattal.html Ashley Lattal'S Paper: Albert Camus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In match reports Camus would often attract positive comment for playing with passion and courage. Any aspirations in football disappeared at age 17, upon contracting tuberculosis—then incurable, Camus was bedridden for long and painful periods.

When Camus was asked in the 1950s by an alumni sports magazine for a few words regarding his time with the RUA, his response included the following:

:After many years during which I saw many things, what I know most surely about morality and the duty of man I owe to sport and learned it in the RUA. &lt;ref name = &quot;rhybma&quot;/&gt;

Camus was referring to a sort of simplistic morality he wrote about in his early essays, the principle of sticking up for your friends, of valuing bravery and fair-play. Camus' belief was that political and religious authorities try to confuse us with over-complicated moral systems to make things appear more complex than they really are, potentially to serve their own needs.

==Cultural influences==
===Film===
Several of Camus' works have been adapted into movies. ''The Stranger'' has been adapted into an Italian [[The Stranger (1967 movie)|1967 movie]] by [[Luchino Visconti]], and also to a 2001 Turkish adaptation titled ''Yazgi'' (''Fate'') by [[Zeki Demirkubuz]]. ''The Plague'' was adapted  to a 1992 film titled ''La Peste'' by [[Luis Puenzo]] and set in modern day America.

===Music===
Quite a few musical artists refer to Camus and his work in their music. The [[post-punk]] band [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] took their name from Camus' novel ''[[The Fall (novel)|The Fall]]''. These also include an album by 
[[Jeff Martin (Canadian musician)|Jeff Martin]](''[[Exile and the Kingdom (album)|Exile and the Kingdom]]'', 2006) and songs by [[Gentle Giant]] (&quot;[[Octopus (album)|A Cry for Everyone]]&quot;, 1972), [[The Cure]] (&quot;[[Killing an Arab]]&quot;, 1978), [[Tuxedomoon]] (&quot;The Stranger&quot;, 1979), [[Digable Planets]] (&quot;[[Reachin' (A New Refutation of Time and Space)]]&quot;, 1993) [[The Magnetic Fields]] (&quot;[[69 Love Songs|I Don't Want To Get Over You]]&quot;, 1999), [[The Manic Street Preachers]] (&quot;[[The Masses Against The Classes]]&quot;, 2000), [[JJ72]] (&quot;[[JJ72 (album)|Algeria]]&quot;, 2000), [[Suede (band)|Suede]] (&quot;[[Obsessions]]&quot;, 2002),  [[Streetlight Manifesto]] (&quot;[[Everything Goes Numb|Here's To Life]]&quot;, 2003), [[A Perfect Circle]] (&quot;[[Thirteenth Step|A Stranger]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Outsider (A Perfect Circle song)|The Outsider]]&quot;, 2003), [[Angela McCluskey]] (&quot;[[The Things We Do|Know it All]]&quot;, 2004), [[Joanna Newsom]] (&quot;[[The Milk-Eyed Mender|This Side of the Blue]]&quot;, 2004), [[Tarkio (band)|Tarkio]] (&quot;[[Omnibus (album)|Neapolitan Bridesmaid]]&quot;, 2006), The Independence, (&quot;20-Ought-Almost-Talkin' Blues&quot;), 2008.

[[Anti-folk]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Jeffrey Lewis]] references Camus, as well as [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]], in a 2005 song, &quot;Williamsburg Will Oldham Horror&quot; in the line, &quot;And I'm sure the thing is probably Dylan himself too, stayed up some nights wishing he was as good as Ginsberg or Camus.&quot;

'''Arthur Asher Miller''' (October 17, 1915 &amp;ndash; February 10, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]] and [[essayist]]. He was a prominent figure in [[American literature]] and [[film|cinema]] for over 61 years, writing a wide variety of [[Play (theatre)|plays]], including celebrated plays such as ''[[The Crucible]]'', ''[[A View from the Bridge]]'', ''[[All My Sons]]'', and ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', which are still studied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Miller was often in the public eye, most famously for refusing to give evidence against others to the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], being the recipient of the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Drama among countless other awards, and for his marriage to [[Marilyn Monroe]].  Miller is considered by audiences and scholars as one of America's greatest playwrights, and his plays are lauded throughout the world.
==Biography==
===Early life===
Arthur Asher Miller was born to moderately affluent Jewish-American parents, Isidore and Augusta Miller,&lt;ref name=&quot;UMICH_Early&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which his family moved to humbler quarters in [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot;&gt;The Times Arthur Miller Obituary, (London: The Times, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] on his family, Miller had little money for college after graduating in 1932 from [[Abraham Lincoln High School (New York)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot;/&gt; Before securing a place at the [[University of Michigan]], he worked in a number of menial jobs to pay for his tuition.  He continued working in Ann Arbor to supplement his income.

At the [[University of Michigan]], Miller first majored in journalism, where he became the reporter and night editor on the student paper, the ''[[Michigan Daily]]''. It was during this time that he wrote his first work, ''[[No Villain]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller switched his major to English, and subsequently won the [[Hopwood Award|Avery Hopwood Award]] for ''No Villain.'' He was mentored by [[Kenneth Thorpe Rowe|Professor Kenneth Rowe]], who instructed him in his early forays into playwrighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller retained strong ties to his alma mater throughout the rest of his life, establishing the university's Arthur Miller Award in 1985 and Arthur Miller Award for Dramatic Writing in 1999, and lending his name to the Arthur Miller Theatre in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, Miller wrote ''[[Honors at Dawn]],'' which also received the Avery Hopwood Award.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;/&gt;

In 1938, Miller received his [[bachelor's degree]] in English. After graduation, he joined the [[Federal Theater Project]], a [[New Deal]] agency established to provide jobs in the theater. He chose the theater project although he had an offer to work as a scriptwriter for [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;/&gt; However, [[United States Congress|Congress]] worried about possible [[communism|Communist]] infiltration, closed the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot;/&gt; Miller began working in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] while continuing to write [[radio plays]], some of which were broadcast on [[CBS Radio|CBS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;/&gt; 

On August 5, 1940, he married his college sweetheart, Mary Slattery, the Catholic daughter of an insurance salesman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;&gt;Michael Ratcliffe, Arthur Miller Obituary, (London: The Observer, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two children, Jane and Robert.  Robert became a director, writer and producer who was, among other things, producer of the 1996 movie version of ''The Crucible''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Miller was exempted from military service during [[World War II]] because of a high-school [[American football|american football]] injury to his left kneecap.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot;/&gt;

Early career'''
In 1944 Miller wrote ''[[The Man Who Had All the Luck]],'' which was produced in New York and won the Theater Guild's National Award.

In 1948 Miller built a small studio in [[Roxbury, Connecticut]], a town that was to be his long time home.  There, in less than a day, he wrote Act I of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]''.  Within six weeks, he completed the rest of the play,&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;/&gt; one of the works for which he is best known.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN_obit&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot;/&gt; ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' premiered on Broadway on February 10, 1949 at the Morosco Theatre, directed by Kazan, and starring [[Lee J. Cobb]] as Willy Loman, [[Mildred Dunnock]] as Linda, [[Arthur Kennedy]] as Biff, and [[Cameron Mitchell]] as Happy.  The play was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, winning a [[Tony Award]] for best play, the New York City [[Drama Circle Critics Award]], and the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for [[Drama]].  It was the first [[play]] to win all three of these major awards.  The searing [[drama]] ran for 742 performances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot;/&gt; 

In 1952, Elia Kazan appeared before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) and, under fear of being blacklisted from Hollywood, named eight black men from the Group Theatre who in recent years had been fellow members of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AmMasters&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened at the Beck Theatre on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on January 22, 1953.  Though widely considered only somewhat successful at the time of its initial release, today ''[[The Crucible]]'' is Miller's most frequently produced work throughout the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;/&gt; Miller and Kazan had been close friends throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, but after Kazan's testimony to HUAC, the pair's friendship ended, and they did not speak to each other for the next ten years.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmMasters&quot;/&gt;  HUAC took an interest in Miller himself not long after ''The Crucible'' opened, denying him a passport to attend the play's London opening in 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;/&gt; Kazan defended his own actions through his film [[On the Waterfront]], in which a dockworker heroically testifies against a corrupt union boss.  Miller was in turn to respond with the play [[A View from the Bridge]], in which another dockworker's decision to inform on two illegal immigrants is based on ignoble, self-serving motives. Miller did have his case overturned and his passport returned. His feelings about HUAC never changed.

Miller's experience with HUAC affected him throughout his life. In the late 1970s he became very interested in the highly publicized Barbara Gibbons murder case, in which Gibbons' son Peter Reilly was convicted of his mother's murder based on what many felt was a coerced confession and little other evidence.  [[City Confidential]], an [[A&amp;E]] program about the murder, postulates that part of the reason Miller took such an active interest (including supporting Reilly's defense and using his own celebrity to bring attention to Reilly's plight) was because he had felt similarly persecuted in his run-in with the HUAC.  He sympathized with Reilly, whom he firmly believed to be innocent and to have been railroaded by the Connecticut State Police and the Attorney General who had initially prosecuted the case. {{Fact|date=October 2007}}

In 1955 a one-act version of Miller's [[verse drama]], ''[[A View from the Bridge|A View From The Bridge]]'', opened on Broadway in a joint bill with one of Miller's lesser-known plays, ''[[A Memory of Two Mondays]]''. The following year, Miller returned to ''A View from the Bridge,'' revising it into a two-act prose version, which [[Peter Brook]] produced in [[London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;/&gt;
'''

===1956 - 1964===
In June 1956 Miller divorced Mary Slattery, and on June 29, he married [[Marilyn Monroe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;/&gt; Miller and Monroe had first met in 1951, when they had a brief affair,&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;/&gt; and had remained in contact since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot;/&gt; 

Taking advantage of the publicity of Miller's marriage, HUAC [[subpoena]]ed him to appear before the committee shortly before the nuptials. Before appearing, Miller asked the committee not to ask him to name names, to which the chairman agreed.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCOnThisDay&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When Miller attended the hearing, to which Monroe accompanied him, risking her own career,&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;/&gt; he gave the committee a detailed account of his political activities. Reneging on the chairman's promise, the committee asked him to reveal to the names of friends and colleagues who had partaken in similar activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCOnThisDay&quot;/&gt; Miller refused to comply with the request, saying &quot;I could not use the name of another person and bring trouble on him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCOnThisDay&quot;/&gt;
As a result a judge found Miller guilty of [[contempt of Congress]] in May 1957. Miller was fined $500, sentenced to thirty days in prison, blacklisted, and disallowed a U.S. passport.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMICH_Early&quot;/&gt; In 1958 his conviction was overturned by the court of appeals, which ruled that Miller had been misled by the chairman of HUAC.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMICH_Early&quot;/&gt;

After his conviction was overturned, Miller began work on ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]'', which starred his wife. Miller said that the filming was one of the lowest points in his life,&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;/&gt; and shortly before the film's premiere in 1961, the pair divorced.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;/&gt; Nineteen months later, Monroe died of an apparent drug overdose.

Miller married photographer [[Inge Morath]] on February 17, 1962, and the first of their two children, [[Rebecca Miller|Rebecca]], was born that September. Their son Daniel was born with [[Down Syndrome]] in November, 1966, and was consequently institutionalized and excluded from the Millers' personal life at Miller's insistence&lt;ref name=&quot;VanityFair&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The couple remained together until Inge's death in 2002. Arthur Miller's son-in-law, actor [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] is said to have visited Daniel frequently, and to have persuaded Arthur Miller to reunite with his adult son &lt;ref name=&quot;DailyMail2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news

===Later career===
In 1964 Miller's next play was produced. ''[[After the Fall (play)|After the Fall]]'' is a deeply personal view of Miller's own experiences during his marriage to Monroe.  The play reunited Miller with his former friend Kazan: they collaborated on both the script and the direction. ''[[After the Fall (play)|After the Fall]]'' opened on January 23, 1964 at the ANTA Theatre in [[Washington Square Park]] amid a flurry of publicity and outrage at putting a Monroe-like character, called Maggie, on stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;/&gt; Also in the same year, Miller produced ''[[Incident at Vichy]]''.
In 1965, Miller was elected the first American president of [[International PEN]], a position which he held for four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period Miller wrote the penetrating family drama, ''[[The Price (play)|The Price]]'', produced in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;/&gt; It was Miller's most successful play since ''Death of a Salesman.''&lt;ref name=&quot;UMICH_60s70s80s&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Miller's works were banned in the [[Soviet Union]] after he campaigned for the freedom of dissident writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;/&gt; Throughout the 1970s, Miller spent much of his time experimenting with the theatre, producing one-act plays such as ''Fame'' and ''The Reason Why'', and traveling with his wife, producing ''In The Country'' and ''Chinese Encounters'' with her. Both his 1972 comedy ''[[The Creation of the World and Other Business]]'' and its musical adaptation, ''[[Up from Paradise]]'', were critical and commercial failures.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In 1983, Miller traveled to the [[People's Republic of China]] to produce and direct ''Death of a Salesman'' at the People's Art Theatre in [[Beijing]].  The play was a success in China&lt;ref name=&quot;UMICH_60s70s80s&quot;/&gt; and in 1984, ''Salesman in Beijing,'' a book about Miller's experience in Beijing, was published. Around the same time, ''Death of a Salesman'' was made into a TV movie starring [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Willy Loman. Shown on CBS, it attracted 25 million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of American Theatre: Post-World War II to the 1990s, Page:296 (Cambridge University Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1987, Miller's [[autobiography]], ''[[Timebends]]'' was published. Before his autobiography was published, it was well known that that Miller would not talk about Monroe in interviews; in ''Timebends'' Miller talks about his experiences with Monroe in detail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;/&gt;
During the early 1990s Miller wrote three new plays, ''[[The Ride Down Mt. Morgan]]'' (1991), ''[[The Last Yankee]]'' (1992), and ''[[Broken Glass (play)|Broken Glass]]'' (1994). 
In 1996, a film of ''The Crucible'' starring [[Daniel Day Lewis]] and [[Winona Ryder]] opened. Miller spent much of 1996 working on the screenplay to the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;/&gt; 
''[[Mr. Peters' Connections]]'' was staged [[off-Broadway]] in 1998, and ''Death of a Salesman'' was revived on Broadway in 1999 to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary. The play, once again, was a large critical success, winning a Tony Award for best revival of a play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On May 1, 2002, Miller was awarded Spain's [[Principe de Asturias Prize for Literature]] as &quot;the undisputed master of modern drama.&quot; Previous winners include [[Doris Lessing]], [[Günter Grass]] and [[Carlos Fuentes]]. Later that year, Ingeborg Morath died of [[Lymphatic cancer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 78. The following year Miller won the [[Jerusalem Prize]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;/&gt;
In December 2004, the 89-year-old Miller announced that he has been living with a 34-year-old [[Minimalism|minimalist painter]] Agnes Barley at his Connecticut farm since 2002, and that they intended to marry. Within hours of her father's death, Rebecca Miller ordered Barley to vacate the premises, having consistently opposed the relationship.
Miller's final play, ''[[Finishing the Picture]]'', opened at the [[Goodman Theatre]], [[Chicago]], in the fall of 2004. He stated that the work was based on the experience of filming ''The Misfits''. 

Miller died at his home in [[Roxbury, Connecticut|Roxbury]] of [[congestive heart failure]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Legacy==
Miller's career as a writer spanned over seven decades, and at the time of his death in 2005, Miller was considered to be one of the greatest dramatists of the twentieth century, among the likes of [[Harold Pinter]], [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], and [[Tennessee Williams]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN_obit&quot;/&gt; After his death, many respected actors, directors, and producers paid tribute to Miller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Non-fiction===
*''Situation Normal'' (1944) is based on his experiences researching the war correspondence of [[Ernie Pyle]]. 
*''In Russia'' (1969), the first of three books created with his photographer wife Inge Morath, offers Miller's impressions of [[Russia]] and Russian society. 
*''In the Country'' (1977), with photographs by Morath and text by Miller, provides insight into how Miller spent his time in Roxbury, Connecticut and profiles of his various neighbors. 
*''Chinese Encounters'' (1979) is a travel journal with photographs by Morath. It depicts the Chinese society in the state of flux which followed the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Miller discusses the hardships of many writers, professors, and artists as they try to regain the sense of freedom and place they lost during [[Mao Zedong]]'s regime. 
*''Salesman in Beijing'' (1984) details Miller's experiences with the 1983 [[Beijing]] People's Theatre production of ''Death of a Salesman''. He describes the idiosyncrasies, understandings, and insights encountered in directing a Chinese cast in a decidedly American play.
*''Timebends: A Life'', Methuen London  (1987) ISBN 0413414809. Like ''Death of a Salesman'', the book follows the structure of memory itself, each passage linked to and triggered by the one before.

'''Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin''' ({{audio-ru|Борис Николаевич Ельцин|ru-Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin.ogg}}; {{IPA-ru|bɐˈrʲis nʲɪkɐˈlaɪvʲɪtɕ ˈjelʲtsɨn}}) (1 February 1931{{ndash}} 23 April 2007) was the first [[President of the Russian Federation]], serving from 1991 to 1999.

Yeltsin came to power with a wave of high expectations. On 12 June 1991 he was elected president of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] with 57% of the vote, becoming the first popularly elected president. But Yeltsin never recovered his popularity after a series of economic and political crises in Russia in the 1990s. The Yeltsin era was marked by widespread corruption, economic collapse, and enormous political and social problems. By the time he left office, Yeltsin had an approval rating of two percent by some estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transcripts of 'Insight' on CNN|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=2002-10-07|accessdate=2007-07-17|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0210/07/i_ins.01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)#Yeltsin and the dissolution of the USSR|dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991, Yeltsin, vowing to transform Russia's [[economy of the Soviet Union|socialist command economy]] into a free [[market economy]], endorsed price liberalization and [[privatization in Russia|privatization programs]]. Due to corruption and other factors, a good deal of the national wealth fell into the hands of a relatively small group of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Åslund|first=Anders|authorlink=Anders Åslund|title=Russia's Collapse|work=Foreign Affairs|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|date=September/October 1999|accessdate=2007-07-17|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19990901faessay1007/anders-aslund/russia-s-collapse.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 1991, Yeltsin won international plaudits for casting himself as a democrat and defying the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August coup attempt of 1991]] by the members of Soviet government opposed to [[perestroika]]. He left office widely unpopular with the Russian population as an ineffectual and ailing [[autocrat]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul J. Saunders, &quot;U.S. Must Ease Away From Yeltsin&quot;, ''Newsday'', 14 May 1999. [http://www.nixoncenter.org/publications/articles/pjs-newsday.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; He either acted as his own prime minister (until June 1992) or appointed men of his choice, regardless of parliament. His confrontations with parliament climaxed in the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993|October 1993 Russian constitutional crisis]], when Yeltsin called up tanks to shell the [[Russian White House]], blasting out his opponents in parliament. Later in 1993, Yeltsin imposed a [[Constitution of Russia|new constitution]] with strong presidential powers, which was approved by [[Russian constitutional referendum, 1993|referendum]] in December.

Just hours before the first day of 2000, Yeltsin made a surprise announcement of his resignation, leaving the presidency in the hands of [[Vladimir Putin]].

==Early life==
Boris Yeltsin was born in the village of [[Butka]], in [[Talitsky District]] of [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]], [[Russia]]. His father, Nikolay Yeltsin, was convicted of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|anti-Soviet agitation]] in 1934 and sentenced to hard labour in a [[gulag]] for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/newsinreview/oct98/russia/timeline.htm|title=Timeline of a Leader|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|date=October 1998|accessdate=2007-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his release he remained unemployed for a period of time and then worked in construction. His mother, Klavdiya Vasilyevna Yeltsina, worked as a seamstress.  

Boris Yeltsin studied at [[Pushkin High School]] in [[Berezniki]] in [[Perm Krai]]. He was fond of sports (in particular [[skiing]], [[gymnastics]], [[volleyball]], [[track and field]], [[boxing]] and [[wrestling]]) despite losing the thumb and index finger of his left hand when he and some friends sneaked into a [[Red Army]] supply depot, stole several grenades, and tried to dissect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/magazinemonitor/2007/04/10_things_we_didnt_know_last_w_21.shtml|title=10 things we didn't know last week|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=[[2007-04-27]]|accessdate=2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeltsin received his higher education at the [[Ural State Technical University]] in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]], majoring in [[construction]], and graduated in 1955. The subject of his degree paper was &quot;Television Tower&quot;.

From 1955 to 1957 he worked as a foreman with the building trust Uraltyazhtrubstroy and from 1957 to 1963 he worked in Sverdlovsk, and was promoted from construction site superintendent to chief of the Construction Directorate with the Yuzhgorstroy Trust. In 1963 he became chief engineer, and in 1965 head of the Sverdlovsk House-Building Combine, responsible for sewerage and technical plumbing. He joined the ranks of the [[CPSU]] ''[[nomenklatura]]'' in 1968 when he was appointed head of construction with the Sverdlovsk Regional Party Committee. In 1975 he became secretary of the regional committee in charge of the region's industrial development. In 1976 the [[Politburo of the CPSU]] promoted him to the post of the first secretary of the CPSU Committee of [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]] (effectively he became the head of one of the most important industrial regions in the USSR), he remained in this position till 1985.

==CPSU member==
Yeltsin was a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) from 1961 to July 1990, and began working in the Communist administration in 1968. He later commented on his [[communist]] views:

:''&quot;I sincerely believed in the ideals of justice propagated by the party, and just as sincerely joined the party, made a thorough study of the charter, the programme and the classics, re-reading the works of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]].&quot;''

In 1977 as party boss in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]], Yeltsin&amp;mdash;on orders from Moscow&amp;mdash;ordered the destruction of the [[Ipatiev House]] where the [[Nicholas II of Russia|last Russian tsar]] had been killed by [[Bolshevik]] troops. The [[Ipatiev House]] was demolished in one night, 27 July 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchfoundationinc.org/Chronology.html Chronology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Also during Yeltsin's stay in Sverdlovsk, a CPSU palace was built which was named &quot;White Tooth&quot; by the residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panorama.ru/works/oe/yeltsine.html Yeltsin Boris Nikolayevich&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;. During this time, Yeltsin developed connections with key people in the Soviet power structure.

He was appointed to the [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]]&lt;!-- ref name=&quot;StrangeDeath77&quot;&gt;''The Strange Death of the Soviet Empire'', page 77; ISBN 0805041540&lt;/ref --&gt;, and was also &quot;Mayor&quot; of [[Moscow]] (First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] Moscow City Committee) from 24 December 1985 to 1987. He was promoted to these high rank positions by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Yegor Ligachev]], who presumed that Yeltsin would be their man. Yeltsin was also given a country house ([[dacha]]) previously occupied by Gorbachev. During this period Yeltsin portrayed himself as a reformer and [[Populism|populist]] (for example, he took a [[trolleybus]] to work), firing and reshuffling his staff several times. His initiatives became popular among Moscow residents.

In 1987, after a confrontation with hardliner [[Yegor Ligachev]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] about Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, meddling in affairs of the state, Yeltsin was sacked from his high ranking party positions. On 21 October 1987 at the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the [[CPSU]], Yeltsin, without prior approval from Gorbachev, lashed out at the Politburo. He expressed his discontent with both the slow pace of reform in society and the servility shown to the General Secretary, then asked to resign from the Politburo, adding that the City Committee would decide whether he should resign from the post of first secretary of the Moscow City Party Committee. In his reply, Gorbachev accused Yeltsin of &quot;political immaturity&quot; and &quot;absolute irresponsibility&quot;, and at the plenary meeting of the Moscow City Party Committee proposed relieving Yeltsin of his post of first secretary. Nobody backed Yeltsin. Criticism of Yeltsin continued on 11 November 1987 at the meeting of the Moscow City Party Committee. After Yeltsin admitted that his speech had been a mistake, he was fired from the post of first secretary of the Moscow City Committee. He was demoted to the position of first deputy commissioner for the State Committee for Construction. After being fired, Yeltsin was hospitalized and later (confirmed by [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]]) attempted suicide. He was perturbed and humiliated but began plotting his revenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;StrangeDeath86&quot;&gt;''The Strange Death of the Soviet Empire'', page 86; ISBN 0-8050-4154-0&lt;/ref&gt; His opportunity came with Gorbachev's establishment of the [[Congress of People's Deputies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;StrangeDeath90&quot;&gt;''The Strange Death of the Soviet Empire'', page 90; ISBN 0-8050-4154-0&lt;/ref&gt; He recovered, and started intensively criticizing Gorbachev, highlighting the slow pace of reform in the Soviet Union as his major argument.

Yeltsin's criticism of the Politburo and Gorbachev led to a smear campaign against him, in which examples of Yeltsin's awkward behavior were used against him. An article published in ''[[Pravda]]'' described him as being drunk at a lecture during his visit to the United States, an allegation which appeared to be confirmed by a TV account of his speech. However, popular dissatisfaction with the regime was very strong, and these attempts to smear Yeltsin only added to his popularity. In another incident, Yeltsin fell from a bridge. Commenting on this event, Yeltsin hinted that he was helped to fall from the bridge by the enemies of [[perestroika]], but his opponents suggested that he was simply drunk.

==President of the RSFSR==

In March 1989, Yeltsin was elected to the [[Congress of People's Deputies]] as the delegate from [[Moscow]] [[district]] and gained a seat on the [[Supreme Soviet]]. 

On 29 May 1990, he was elected [[chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR]] ([[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]]), the post he held until 10 July 1991. He was supported by both democratic and conservative members of the [[Supreme Soviet]], which sought power in the developing political situation in the country. A part of this power struggle was the opposition between power structures of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]]. In an attempt to gain more power, on 12 June 1990, the Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR adopted a declaration of sovereignty and Yeltsin quit the CPSU in July 1990.

On 12 June 1991, Yeltsin won 57% of the popular vote in the [[Russian presidential election, 1991|democratic presidential elections]] for the Russian republic, defeating Gorbachev's preferred candidate, [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]]. In his election campaign, Yeltsin criticized the &quot;dictatorship of the center&quot;, but did not suggest the introduction of a market economy. Instead, he said that he would put his head on the railtrack in the event of increased prices. Yeltsin took office on 10 July.

On 18 August 1991, a [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|coup against Gorbachev]] was launched by the government members opposed to perestroika headed by [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]]. Gorbachev was held in [[Crimea]] while Yeltsin raced to the [[White House of Russia]] (residence of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR) in Moscow to defy the coup. The White House was surrounded by the military but the troops defected in the face of mass popular demonstrations. Yeltsin responded to the coup by making a memorable speech from the turret of a tank. By 21 August most of the coup leaders had fled Moscow and Gorbachev was &quot;rescued&quot; from [[Crimea]] and then returned to Moscow. Yeltsin was subsequently hailed by his supporters around the world for rallying mass opposition to the coup.

Although restored to his position, Gorbachev's powers were now fatally compromised. Neither union nor Russian power structures heeded his commands as support had swung over to Yeltsin. Through the fall of 1991, the Russian government took over the union government, ministry by ministry. 

On 6 November 1991, Yeltsin issued a decree banning the Communist Party throughout the RSFSR.

In early December 1991, [[Ukraine]] voted for independence from the Soviet Union. A week later, on 8 December, Yeltsin met with Ukrainian president [[Leonid Kravchuk]] and the leader of [[Belarus]], [[Stanislav Shushkevich]], in [[Belovezhskaya Pushcha]], where the three presidents announced the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] and that they would establish a voluntary [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) in its place. According to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the president of the [[Soviet Union]] at that time, Yeltsin kept the plans of the Belovezhskaya meeting in strict secrecy and the main goal of the dissolution of the Soviet Union was to get rid of Gorbachev, who by that time had started to recover his position after the events of August. [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] has also accused Yeltsin of violating the people's will expressed in the referendum in which the majority voted to keep the [[Soviet Union]].

On 24 December, the [[Russian Federation]] took the Soviet Union's seat in the [[United Nations]]. The next day, President Gorbachev resigned and [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union ceased to exist]], thereby ending the world's largest and most influential socialist state. Economic relations between the former Soviet republics were severely compromised. Millions of ethnic Russians found themselves in the newly formed foreign countries.

==President of the Russian Federation==
===Yeltsin's first term===
====Radical reforms====

Just days after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Boris Yeltsin resolved to embark on a program of radical economic reform, with the aim of restructuring Russia's economic system—converting the world's largest command economy into a free-market one. During early discussions of this transition, Yeltsin's advisers debated issues of speed and sequencing, with an apparent division between those favoring a rapid approach and those favoring a gradual or slower approach.

In late 1991 Yeltsin turned to the advice of Western economists, and Western institutions such as the [[IMF]], the [[World Bank]], and the [[U.S. Treasury Department]], who had developed a standard policy recipe for transition economies in the late 1980s. This policy recipe came to be known as the &quot;[[Washington Consensus]]&quot; or &quot;[[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]&quot;, a combination of measures intended to liberalize prices and stabilize the state's budget. Such measures had been attempted in Poland, and advocates of &quot;shock therapy&quot; felt the same could be done in Russia. Some Russian policymakers were skeptical that this was the way to go, but the approach was favored by Yeltsin's deputy, [[Yegor Gaidar]], a 35-year-old Russian economist inclined toward radical reform.

On 2 January 1992, Yeltsin, acting as his own [[Prime Minister of Russia|prime minister]], ordered the liberalization of foreign trade, prices, and currency. At the same time, Yeltsin followed a policy of 'macroeconomic stabilization,' a harsh austerity regime designed to control inflation. Under Yeltsin's stabilization program, interest rates were raised to extremely high levels to tighten money and restrict credit. To bring state spending and revenues into balance, Yeltsin raised new taxes heavily, cut back sharply on government subsidies to industry and construction, and made steep cuts to state welfare spending.

In early 1992, prices skyrocketed throughout Russia, and deep credit crunch shut down many industries and brought about a protracted depression. The reforms devastated the living standards of much of the population, especially the groups dependent on Soviet-era state subsidies and [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] [[entitlement program]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nolan, ''China's Rise, Russia's Fall''. Macmillan Press, 1995. pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1990s, Russia's [[GDP]] fell by 50 percent, vast sectors of the economy were wiped out, inequality and unemployment grew dramatically, while incomes fell. [[Hyperinflation]], caused by the Central Bank of Russia's loose monetary policy, wiped out a lot of personal savings, and tens of millions of [[Russians]] were plunged into [[poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Treisman, &quot;Why Yeltsin Won: A Russian Tammany Hall&quot;, ''Foreign Affairs'', September/October 1996. [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19960901faessay3402/daniel-treisman/why-yeltsin-won-a-russian-tammany-hall.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodore P. Gerber, Michael Hout, &quot;More Shock than Therapy: Market Transition, Employment, and Income in Russia, 1991–1995&quot;, AJS Volume 104 Number 1 (July 1998): 1–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists argue that in the 1990s Russia suffered an economic downturn more severe than the United States or Germany had undergone six decades earlier in the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nolan, ''China's Rise, Russia's Fall''. Macmillan Press, 1995. pp. 17&amp;ndash;18.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian commentators and even some Western economists, such as [[Marshall Goldman]], widely blamed Yeltsin's Western-backed economic program for the country's disastrous economic performance in the 1990s. Many politicians began to quickly distance themselves from the program. In February 1992, Russia's vice president, [[Alexander Rutskoy]] denounced the Yeltsin program as &quot;economic genocide.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Celestine Bohlen, &quot;Yeltsin Deputy Calls Reforms 'Economic Genocide,'&quot; ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 February 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1993 conflict over the reform direction escalated between Yeltsin on the one side, and the opposition to radical economic reform in Russia's parliament on the other.

====Confrontation with parliament====
{{main|1993 Russian constitutional crisis}}
Also throughout 1992, Yeltsin wrestled with the [[Supreme Soviet]] and the Congress of People's Deputies for control over government, government policy, government banking and property. In the course of 1992, the speaker of the Russian Supreme Soviet, [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]], came out in opposition to the reforms, despite claiming to support Yeltsin's overall goals. In December 1992, the 7th Congress of People's Deputies succeeded in turning down the Yeltsin-backed candidacy of Yegor Gaidar for the position of [[Prime Minister of Russia|Russian prime minister]]. Eventually, on 14 December, [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]], seen as a compromise figure, was confirmed in the office.

The conflict escalated on 20 March 1993 when Yeltsin, in a televised address to the nation, announced that he was going to assume certain &quot;special powers&quot; in order to implement his program of reforms. In response, the hastily-called 9th Congress of People's Deputies attempted to remove Yeltsin from presidency through impeachment on 26 March 1993. Yeltsin's opponents gathered more than 600 votes for impeachment, but fell 72 votes short of the required two-thirds majority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acs.brockport.edu/~dgusev/Russian/bybio.html Boris Yeltsin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
On 21 September 1993 Yeltsin announced in a televised address his decision to disband the Supreme Soviet and Congress of People's Deputies by decree.

In his address Yeltsin declared his intent to rule by decree until the election of the new parliament and a referendum on a new constitution, triggering the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993|constitutional crisis of October 1993]]. On the night after Yeltsin's televised address, the Supreme Soviet declared Yeltsin removed from presidency, by virtue of his breaching the constitution, and Vice-President Alexander Rutskoy was sworn in as the acting president.

Between 21–24 September Yeltsin was confronted by significant popular unrest, encouraging the defenders of the parliament. Moscow saw what amounted to a spontaneous mass uprising of anti-Yeltsin demonstrators numbering in the tens of thousands marching in the streets resolutely seeking to aid forces defending the parliament building. The demonstrators were protesting the new and terrible living conditions under Yeltsin. Since 1989 GDP had declined by half. Corruption was rampant, violent crime was skyrocketing, medical services were collapsing, food and fuel were increasingly scarce and life expectancy was falling for all but a tiny handful of the population; moreover, Yeltsin was increasingly getting the blame.

By early October, Yeltsin had secured the support of Russia's army and ministry of interior forces. In a massive show of force, Yeltsin called up tanks to shell the [[Russian White House]], Russia's parliament building, blasting out his opponents. As a result, hundreds died and thousands were wounded. 

As Supreme Soviet was dissolved, in December 1993 elections to the newly established parliament, the [[State Duma]], were held. Candidates associated with Yeltsin's economic policies were overwhelmed by a huge anti-Yeltsin vote, the bulk of which was divided between the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]] and ultra-nationalists. The referendum, however, held at the same time, approved the new constitution, which significantly expanded the powers of the president, giving Yeltsin a right to appoint the members of the government, to dismiss the [[Prime Minister|prime minister]] and, in some cases, to dissolve the Duma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/ch4.html Russian Constitution SECTION ONE Chapter 4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chechnya====
{{main|First Chechen War}}

In December 1994, Yeltsin ordered the military invasion of [[Chechnya]] in an attempt to restore Moscow's control over the separatist republic. Nearly two years later Yeltsin withdrew federal forces from the devastated Chechnya under a 1996 peace agreement brokered by [[Alexander Lebed]], then Yeltsin's security chief. The peace deal allowed Chechnya greater autonomy but not full independence.

The decision to launch the war in Chechnya dismayed many in the West. [[TIME magazine]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Then, what was to be made of Boris Yeltsin? Clearly he could no longer be regarded as the democratic hero of Western myth. But had he become an old- style communist boss, turning his back on the democratic reformers he once championed and throwing in his lot with militarists and ultranationalists? Or was he a befuddled, out-of-touch chief being manipulated, knowingly or unwittingly, by{{ndash}} well, by whom exactly? If there was to be a dictatorial coup, would Yeltsin be its victim or its leader?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982323-1,00.html Death Trap - TIME&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Privatization and the rise of &quot;the oligarchs&quot;====
{{main|Privatization in Russia}}

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Yeltsin promoted [[privatization in Russia|privatization]] as a way of spreading ownership of shares in former state enterprises as widely as possible to create political support for his economic reforms. In the West, privatization was viewed as the key to the transition from communism in Eastern Europe, ensuring a quick dismantling of the Soviet-era command economy to make way for 'free market reforms.' In the early 1990s, [[Anatoly Chubais]], Yeltsin's deputy for economic policy, emerged as a leading advocate of privatization in Russia.

In late 1992, Yeltsin launched a program of free vouchers as a way to give mass privatization a jump-start. Under the program, all Russian citizens were issued vouchers, each with a nominal value of around 10,000 rubles, for purchase of shares of select state enterprises. Although each citizen initially received a voucher of equal face value, within months most of them converged in the hands of intermediaries who were ready to buy them for cash right away.

In 1995, as Yeltsin struggled to finance Russia's growing foreign debt and gain support from the Russian business elite for his bid in the spring 1996 presidential elections, the Russian president prepared for a new wave of privatization offering stock shares in some of Russia's most valuable state enterprises in exchange for bank loans. The program was promoted as a way of simultaneously speeding up privatization and ensuring the government a much-needed infusion of cash for its operating needs.

However, the deals were effectively giveaways of valuable state assets to a small group of tycoons in finance, industry, energy, telecommunications, and the media who came to be known as &quot;[[Business oligarch|oligarchs]]&quot; in the mid-1990s. By summer 1996, substantial ownership shares over major firms were acquired at very low prices by a handful of people. [[Boris Berezovsky]], who controlled major stakes in several banks and the national media, emerged as one of Yeltsin's most prominent backers. Along with Berezovsky, [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], [[Vladimir Potanin]], [[Vladimir Bogdanov]], [[Rem Viakhirev]], [[Vagit Alekperov]], [[Alexander Smolensky]], [[Victor Vekselberg]], [[Mikhail Fridman]] and a few years later [[Roman Abramovich]], were habitually mentioned in the media as Russia's oligarchs.

====The Yeltsin/Senator Helms interchange====
On 5 December 1991, [[Jesse Helms|Senator Jesse Helms]], ranking member of the Minority Staff of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, wrote to Boris Yeltsin concerning U.S. servicemen who were POWs or MIAs. &quot;The status of thousands and thousands of American servicemen who are held by Soviet and other Communist forces, and who were never repatriated after every major war this century, is of grave concern to the American people.&quot; 

Yeltsin would ultimately respond with a statement made on 15 June 1992, while being interviewed aboard his presidential jet on his way to the United States, &quot;Our archives have shown that it is true — some of them were transferred to the territory of the U.S.S.R. and were kept in labor camps... We can only surmise that some of them may still be alive.&quot; On 10 December 1991, just five days after Senator Helms had written Yeltsin concerning American servicemen, he again wrote to Yeltsin, this time concerning KAL 007. 

&quot;One of the greatest tragedies of the Cold War was the shoot-down of the [[Korean Airlines Flight 007]] by the Armed Forces of what was then the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983... The KAL-007 tragedy was one of the most tense incidences of the entire Cold War. However, now that relations between our two nations have improved substantially, I believe that it is time to resolve the mysteries surrounding this event. 

Clearing the air on this issue could help further to improve relations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rescue007.org/helms_letter.htm Helms' Letter to Yeltsin - December 1991&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot; In March of 1992, Yeltsin would hand over KAL 007's Black Box without its tapes to Korean President [[Roh Tae-Woo]] at the end of the plenary session of the Korean National Assembly with this statement, &quot;We apologize for the tragedy and are trying to settle some unsolved issues.&quot;

Yeltsin would ultimately respond on 8 January 1992 by handing over to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) of the United Nations what the Russians had for so many years denied possessing: the tapes of the KAL 007's &quot;Black Box&quot; (its [[Digital]] [[Flight Data Recorder]] and [[Cockpit Voice Recorder]])&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rescue007.org/docs/Is%20This%20the%20Final%20Word.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The openness of Yeltsin about POW/MIA and KAL 007 matters may also have signaled his willingness for more openness to the West. In 1992, which he labelled the &quot;window of opportunity&quot;, he was willing to discuss biological weapons with the U.S. but never admitted that the [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak]] of 2 April 1979 had been caused as a result of a mishap at a military facility.&lt;ref&gt;Knoph JT, Westerdahl KS: Re-evaluating Russia's biological weapons policy, as reflected in the Criminal Code and Official Admissions: insubordination leading to a president's subordination. Crit Rev Microbiol. 2006;32(1):1-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian government has maintained that the cause was contaminated meat. The true number of victims in the anthrax outbreak at Sverdlovsk, about {{convert|850|mi|km|0}} east of Moscow, is not known.

====1996 presidential election====
In February 1996, Yeltsin announced that he would seek a second term in the [[Russian presidential election, 1996|spring 1996 Russian presidential election]]. The announcement followed weeks of speculation that Yeltsin was at the end of his political career because of his health problems and growing unpopularity in Russia. At the time Yeltsin was recuperating from a series of heart attacks. Domestic and international observers also noted his occasionally erratic behaviour. When campaigning opened at the beginning of 1996, Yeltsin's popularity was close to zero.&lt;ref&gt;CNN, Russian presidential candidate profiles, 1906.[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/pivotal.elections/1996/russia/candidate.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the opposition [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] had already gained ground in parliamentary voting on 17 December 1995, and its candidate, [[Gennady Zyuganov]], had a strong grass roots organization, especially in the rural areas and small towns, and appealed effectively to memories of the old days of Soviet prestige on the international stage and the socialist domestic order.&lt;ref&gt;CNN, Gennady Zyuganov candidate profile, 1996. [http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9602/russia_zyuganov/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Panic struck the Yeltsin team when opinion polls suggested that the ailing president could not win; some members of his entourage urged him to cancel presidential elections and effectively rule as dictator from then on. Instead, Yeltsin changed his campaign team, assigning a key role to his daughter, [[Tatyana Dyachenko]], and appointing Chubais as campaign manager.&lt;ref&gt;http://vms.cc.wmich.edu/~97levintova/Ny.html&lt;/ref&gt; Chubais, acting as both Yeltsin's campaign manager and adviser on Russia's privatisation programme, used his control of the privatisation programme as an instrument of Yeltsin's reelection campaign.

In the spring of 1996, Chubais and Yeltsin recruited a team of a handful of financial and media oligarchs to bankroll the Yeltsin campaign and guaranteed favorable media coverage the president on national television and in leading newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Treisman, &quot;Blaming Russia First&quot;, ''Foreign Affairs'', November/December 2000. [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20001101fareviewessay946/daniel-treisman/blaming-russia-first.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In return, Chubais allowed well-connected Russian business leaders to acquire majority stakes in some of Russia's most valuable state-owned assets.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Pekka Sutela, &quot;Insider Privatization in Russia: Speculations on Systemic Changes&quot;, ''Europe-Asia Studies'' 46:3 (1994), p. 420–21. &lt;/ref&gt; The media painted a picture of a fateful choice for Russia, between Yeltsin and a &quot;return to totalitarianism.&quot; The oligarchs even played up the threat of civil war if a Communist were elected president.

Yeltsin campaigned energetically, dispelling concerns about his health, and maintained a high media profile. To boost his popularity, Yeltsin promised to abandon some his more unpopular economic reforms, boost welfare spending, end the war in Chechnya, and pay wage and pension arrears. Yeltsin's campaign also got a boost from the announcement of a $10&amp;nbsp;billion loan to the Russian government from the International Monetary Fund.&lt;ref&gt;CNN Interactive: Pivotal Elections: Russian Elections; Candidates: Boris Yeltsin [http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/pivotal.elections/1996/russia/candidate.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zyuganov, who lacked Yeltsin's resources and financial backing, saw his strong initial lead whittle away. After the first round on 16 June Yeltsin appointed a highly popular candidate [[Alexander Lebed]], who came in third in the first round, Secretary of the [[Security Council of Russia]], sacked at the latter's behest defence minister [[Pavel Grachev]] and on 20 June sacked a number of his ''[[siloviki]]'', one of them being his chief of presidential security [[Alexander Korzhakov]], viewed by many as Yeltsin's [[éminence grise]].

In the run-off on 3 July, with a turnout of 68.9%, Yeltsin won 53.8% of the vote and Zyuganov 40.3%, with the rest (5.9%) voting &quot;[[blank vote|against all]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hockstader, Washington Post Foreign Service, Friday, 5 July 1996 [http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/russiagov/stories/premier070596.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his second term, Yeltsin was unable to follow through on most of his campaign promises, except for ending the Chechen war, which was halted for most of the period.

===Yeltsin's second term===
[[Image:BorisYeltsin and BillClinton 1999-11-18.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Boris Yeltsin and [[Bill Clinton]] in 1999]]

In July 1996, Yeltsin was re-elected as president with financial support from influential [[business oligarchs]] who owed their wealth to their connections with Yeltsin's administration. Despite only gaining 35% of the first round vote in the 1996 elections, Yeltsin defeated his communist rival [[Gennady Zyuganov]] with 54% in the runoff election. Later that year, Yeltsin underwent an emergency [[Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery#Number_of_bypasses|quintuple heart bypass surgery]] and remained in the hospital for months.

During Yeltsin's presidency, Russia received [[US$]] 40 billion in funds from the [[IMF]] and other international lending organizations. However, his opponents allege that most of these funds were stolen by people from Yeltsin's circle and placed in foreign banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/articles/?a=1999/7/26/125259|title=Where Is the IMF Money to Russia Really Going?|author=Stanislav Lunev|publisher=[[NewsMax.com]]|date=[[1999-07-27]]|accessdate=2007-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-spark.net/csart264.html|title=Yeltsin, &quot;The Family&quot; and the Bureaucratic Mafia|author=the-spark.net|date=[[2003-07-19]]|accessdate=2007-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/c-asia/AI11Ag01.html|title=Checkmate nears for Yeltsin|author=[[Asia Times Online]]|date=[[1999-09-10]]|accessdate=2007-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, a political and economic crisis emerged when Yeltsin's government defaulted on its debts, causing financial markets to panic and the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] to collapse in the [[Russian financial crisis of 1998|1998 financial crisis]].

During the 1999 [[Kosovo war]], Yeltsin strongly opposed the [[NATO]] military campaign against [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and warned of possible Russian intervention if NATO deployed ground troops to Kosovo. In televised comments he stated: &quot;I told NATO, the Americans, the Germans: Don't push us toward military action. Otherwise there will be a European war for sure and possibly world war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yeltsin Warns Of European War Over Kosovo |publisher=Reuters |date=1999-04-09 |}} Also, {{cite news |title=Yeltsin warns of possible world war over Kosovo |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9904/09/kosovo.diplomacy.02/ |publisher=CNN |date=1999-04-09 |accessdate=2007-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May 1999, Yeltsin survived another attempt of [[impeachment]], this time by the [[Yabloko|democratic]] and [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|communist]] opposition in the [[State Duma]]. He was charged with several unconstitutional activities, including the signing of the [[Belavezha Accords]], dissolving the [[Soviet Union]] in December 1991, the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|coup-d'état in October 1993]], and initiating the war in [[Chechnya]] in 1994. None of these charges received the two-thirds majority of the Duma which was required to initiate the process of [[impeachment]] of the president.

On 9 August 1999 Yeltsin fired his prime minister, [[Sergei Stepashin]], and for the fourth time, fired his entire cabinet. In Stepashin's place he appointed [[Vladimir Putin]], relatively unknown at that time, and announced his wish to see Putin as his successor.

In late 1999 Yeltsin and President Clinton openly disagreed on the war in Chechnya. At the November meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Clinton pointed his finger at Yeltsin and demanded he halt bombing attacks that had resulted in many civilian casualties. Yeltsin immediately left the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Babington |title=Clinton Spars With Yeltsin On Chechnya, President Denounces Killing of Civilians |publisher=Washington Post |date=1999-11-19|pages= A01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December while visiting China to seek support on Chechnya, Yeltsin replied to Clinton’s criticism of a Russian ultimatum to citizens of Grozney. He bluntly pronounced: &quot;Yesterday, Clinton permitted himself to put pressure on Russia. It seems he has for a minute, for a second, for half a minute, forgotten that Russia has a full arsenal of nuclear weapons. He has forgotten about that.&quot; Clinton dismissed Yeltsin's comments stating: &quot;I didn't think he'd forgotten that America was a great power when he disagreed with what I did in Kosovo.&quot; It fell to Vladimir Putin to downplay Yeltsin's comments and present reassurances about U.S. and Russian relations.&lt;ref&gt;

====Resignation====

On 31 December 1999, in a surprise announcement aired at 12:00 noon on Russian television and taped in the morning of the same day, Yeltsin said he had resigned and Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] had taken over as acting president, with elections due to take place on 26 March 2000. Yeltsin asked for forgiveness for what he acknowledged were errors of his rule, and said Russia needed to enter the new century with new political leaders. Yeltsin said: &quot;I want to beg forgiveness for your dreams that never came true. And also I would like to beg forgiveness not to have justified your hopes.&quot;

==Alleged alcoholism and neurological disorder==
According to numerous reports, Yeltsin struggled with alcoholism. The subject made headlines abroad during Yeltsin's visit to the U.S. in 1989 for a series of lectures on social and political life in the Soviet Union. That trip was described by a report in the Italian newspaper ''[[La Repubblica]]''. The article reported that Yeltsin often appeared drunk in public. The article was reprinted by ''[[Pravda]]''. Yeltsin's alleged alcoholism was also the subject of media discussion following his meeting with U.S. [[Deputy Secretary of State]] [[Strobe Talbott]] following Clinton's inauguration in 1993 and after his flight stop-over at [[Shannon Airport]], Ireland in September 1994 when the waiting Irish Taoiseach (prime minister) [[Albert Reynolds]] was told that Yeltsin was unwell and would not be leaving the aircraft.

According to former Deputy Prime Minister of Russia [[Boris Nemtsov]], the bizarre behavior of Yeltsin resulted from &quot;strong drugs&quot; given to him by Kremlin's doctors, which were incompatible even with a small amount of alcohol. This was discussed by journalist [[Yelena Tregubova]] from the &quot;[[Kremlin's pool]]&quot; in connection with an episode during Yeltsin's visit to [[Stockholm]] in 1997 when Yeltsin suddenly started talking nonsense (he allegedly told his bemused audience that Swedish meatballs reminded him of [[Björn Borg]]'s face), lost his balance, and almost fell down on the podium after drinking a single glass of Champagne&lt;ref&gt;[[Yelena Tregubova]] ''Tales of a Kremlin Digger'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Елена Трегубова. Байки кремлевского диггера., Mосква., Ad Marginem, 2003 ISBN 5-93321-073-0 [http://www.az-design.ru/Projects/AZLibrCD/290/c2ebe/books/001btoc.shtml Full text in Russian]. [http://www.perlentaucher.de/artikel/3350.html German translation]. Tregubova barely escaped an assassination attempt after publishing this material [http://www.cpj.org/news/2004/Russia02feb04na.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Yeltsin, in his memoirs, claimed no recollection of the event but did however make a passing reference to the incident when he met Borg a year later at The World Circle Kabaddi Cup in Hamilton, Ontario, where the pair had been invited to present the trophy.&lt;ref&gt; Yeltsin, B &quot;Midnight Diaries&quot;, New York, p.344 &lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Yeltsin made a hasty withdrawal from the funeral of [[Hussein of Jordan]] in February 1999. ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Елена Трегубова. Байки кремлевского диггера., Mосква., Ad Marginem, 2003 ISBN 5-93321-073-0 [http://www.az-design.ru/Projects/AZLibrCD/290/c2ebe/books/001btoc.shtml Full text in Russian]. [http://www.perlentaucher.de/artikel/3350.html German translation]. 

After Yeltsin's death, a Dutch neurosurgeon revealed that his team was secretly flown to Moscow to operate on Yeltsin in 1999. Yeltsin suffered from an unspecified neurological disorder that affected his sense of balance, causing him to wobble as if in a drunken state; the goal of the operation was to reduce the pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.rug.nl/archief/jaargang36/31/03f5.php|title=University professor reveals neurological disorder|publisher=Rijks Universiteit Groningen|date=[[2007-05-03]]|accessdate=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life after resignation==
Yeltsin's personal and health problems received a great deal of attention in the global press. As the years went on, he was often viewed as an increasingly unstable leader, rather than the inspiring figure he was once seen as. The possibility that he might die in office was often discussed.
Starting in the last years of his presidential term, Yeltsin's primary residence was the ''Gorki-9'' presidential dacha west of Moscow. He made frequent stays at the nearby government sanatorium in [[Barvikha]].

Yeltsin maintained a low profile after his resignation, making almost no public statements or appearances. However, on 13 September 2004, following the [[Beslan school hostage crisis]] and nearly-concurrent terrorist attacks in Moscow, Putin launched an initiative to replace the election of regional governors with a system whereby they would be directly appointed by the president and approved by regional legislatures. Yeltsin, together with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], publicly criticized Putin's plan as a step away from democracy in Russia and a return to the centrally-run political apparatus of the Soviet era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosnews.com/news/2004/09/16/exleaders.shtml|title=Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin Speak out Against Putin’s Reforms|publisher=MosNews.com|date=[[2004-09-16]]|accessdate=2007-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, Yeltsin underwent a hip operation in Moscow after breaking his [[femur]] in a fall while vacationing on the [[Italy|Italian]] island of [[Sardinia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.com/p609848/r_1/Boris_Yeltsin_Leaves_Ward/|title=Boris Yeltsin Leaves Ward|author=Yulia Osipova|publisher=[[Kommersant]]|date=[[2005-09-19]]|accessdate=2007-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2006, Yeltsin celebrated his 75th birthday. He used this occasion as an opportunity to criticize a &quot;monopolistic&quot; U.S. foreign policy, and to state that [[Vladimir Putin]] was the right choice for Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosnews.com/interview/2006/01/30/yeltsin.shtml|title=Putin Was Right Choice for Russia—Boris Yeltsin|publisher=MosNews.com|date=[[2006-01-30]]|accessdate=2007-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also disputed accusations of corruption.

===Passion for tennis===

Yeltsin also used his retirement to pursue his considerable love of tennis. He was a frequent fixture at tournaments held in Russia, notably Russian Davis Cup and Federation Cup team events. Far from a passive supporter like many VIPs who attend sports events, Yeltsin gained a reputation as an animated fan, cheering and jumping in support of the Russians. When the Russian men won the Davis Cup in 2002 and 2006 Yeltsin descended the stands to celebrate with the players, group hugging the team.

Following his death in April 2007, his widow, Naina, attended in Yeltsin's place the final of that year's Federation Cup, in which Russia's women comprehensively beat Italy.

[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1695880.ece]

Yeltsin is survived by his wife, [[Naina Yeltsina|Naina Iosifovna Yeltsina]], whom he married in 1956, and their two daughters Yelena and [[Tatyana Dyachenko|Tatyana]], born in 1957 and 1959 respectively.

'''{{RUS}}'''—Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] said, declaring 25 April 2007, a day of national mourning, that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yeltsin's &quot;presidency has inscribed him forever in Russian and in world history.&quot; ... &quot;A new democratic Russia was born during his time: a free, open and peaceful country. A state in which the power truly does belong to the people.&quot; ... &quot;the first President of Russia’s strength consisted in the mass support of Russian citizens for his ideas and aspirations. Thanks to the will and direct initiative of President Boris Yeltsin a new constitution, one which declared human rights a supreme value, was adopted. It gave people the opportunity to freely express their thoughts, to freely choose power in Russia, to realise their creative and entrepreneurial plans. This Constitution permitted us to begin building a truly effective Federation.&quot; ... &quot;We knew (Yeltsin) as a brave and a warm-hearted, spiritual person. He was an upstanding and courageous national leader. And he was always very honest and frank while defending his position.&quot; ... &quot;(Yeltsin) assumed full responsibility for everything he called for, for everything he aspired to. For everything he tried to do and did do for the sake of Russia, for the sake of millions of Russians. And he invariably took upon himself, let it in his heart, all the trials and tribulations of Russia, peoples’ difficulties and problems.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://president.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2007/04/23/2207_type82912_125079.shtml Vladimir Putin`s Address on the Occasion of Boris Yelstin’s Passing] Kremlin, 23 April 2007. Retrieved: 2007-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''{{RUS}}'''—Shortly after the news broke, former Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] issued a statement, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;I offer my deepest condolences to the family of a man on whose shoulders rested many great deeds for the good of the country and serious mistakes—a tragic fate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6584785.stm ''In quotes: Reactions to Yeltsin death''] 23 April 2007. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Ernest Miller Hemingway''' (July 21, 1899 — July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, [[short story author|short-story writer]], and [[journalist]]. He was part of the 1920s [[expatriate]] community in [[Paris, France|Paris]], and one of the veterans of [[World War I]] later known as &quot;the [[Lost Generation]].&quot; He received the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1953 for ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]],'' and the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1954.

Hemingway's [[Iceberg Theory|distinctive writing style]] is characterized by economy and [[understatement]], and had a significant influence on the development of twentieth-century [[fiction]] writing. His [[protagonist]]s are typically [[stoicism|stoical]] men who exhibit an ideal described as &quot;grace under pressure.&quot; Many of his works are now considered classics of [[American literature]].

==Early life ==
[[Image:ErnestHemingwayBabyPicture.JPG|thumb|left|Ernest Hemingway, c. 1900]]
Ernest Miller Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899 in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], a suburb of [[Chicago]]. Hemingway was the first son and the second child born to Clarence Edmonds &quot;Doc Ed&quot; Hemingway - a country [[Physician|doctor]], and Grace Hall Hemingway. Hemingway's father attended the birth of Ernest and blew a horn on his front porch to announce to the neighbors that his wife had given birth to a boy. The Hemingways lived in a six-bedroom Victorian house built by Ernest's widowed maternal grandfather, Ernest Miller Hall, an English immigrant and [[American Civil War|Civil War veteran]] who lived with the family. Hemingway was his namesake. 
[[Image:Hemingway birthplace.jpg|thumb|Birthplace in [[Oak Park, Illinois]]]]
Hemingway's mother once aspired to an [[opera]] career and earned money giving voice and music lessons. She was domineering and narrowly religious, mirroring the strict [[Protestant]] ethic of Oak Park, which Hemingway later said had &quot;wide lawns and narrow minds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;From [http://www.lostgeneration.com/childhood.htm Childhood] At ''The Hemingway Resource Center''.&lt;/ref&gt; While his mother hoped that her son would develop an interest in music, Hemingway adopted his father's outdoorsman hobbies of hunting, fishing and camping in the woods and lakes of [[Northern Michigan]]. The family owned a summer home called ''Windemere'' on [[Walloon Lake]], near [[Petoskey, Michigan]] and often spent summers vacationing there. These early experiences in close contact with nature instilled in Hemingway a lifelong passion for outdoor adventure and for living in remote or isolated areas.

Hemingway attended [[Oak Park and River Forest High School]] from September 1913 until graduation in June 1917. He excelled both academically and athletically; he [[Boxing|boxed]], played [[American football]], and displayed particular talent in [[English studies|English]] classes. His first writing experience was writing for &quot;Trapeze&quot; and &quot;Tabula&quot; (the school's newspaper and yearbook, respectively) in his junior year, then serving as editor in his senior year. He sometimes wrote under the [[pen name]] Ring Lardner, Jr., a nod to his literary hero [[Ring Lardner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tridget.com/friends.htm|title = &quot;Lardner Connections&quot;|accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After high school, Hemingway did not want to go to college. Instead, at age eighteen, he began his writing career as a cub [[reporter]] for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]''. Although he worked at the newspaper for only six months (October 17, 1917-April 30, 1918), throughout his lifetime he used the guidance of the ''Star'''s [[style guide]] as a foundation for his writing style: &quot;Use short sentences. Use short first paragraphs. Use vigorous English. Be positive, not negative.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Many such anecdotes are compiled at [http://www.kcstar.com/hemingway/ the centennial commemoration page of the ''Kansas City Star''].&lt;/ref&gt; In honor of the centennial year of Hemingway's birth (1899), ''The Star'' named Hemingway its top reporter of the last hundred years.

==World War I==
Hemingway left his reporting job after only a few months and, against his father's wishes, tried to join the [[United States Army]] to see action in [[World War I]]. He failed the medical examination due to poor vision, and instead joined the [[Red Cross]] [[Ambulance]] Corps. On his route to the Italian front, he stopped in [[Paris]], which was under constant bombardment from German artillery. Instead of staying in the relative safety of the Hotel Florida, Hemingway tried to get as close to combat as possible.
[[Image:EH2723PMilan1918.jpg|thumb|Hemingway in [[World War I]] uniform]]
Soon after arriving on the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Front]] Hemingway witnessed the brutalities of war. On his first day on duty an [[ammunition]] factory near [[Milan]] blew up. Hemingway had to pick up the human—primarily female—remains. Hemingway wrote about this experience in his short story &quot;[[A Natural History of the Dead]]&quot;. This first encounter with death left him shaken.

The soldiers he met later did not lighten the horror. One of them, [[Eric Dorman-Smith]], entertained Hemingway with a line from [[Henry IV, part 2|Part Two of Shakespeare's ''Henry IV'', Act III, Scene II]]: &quot;By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once; we owe God a death...and let it go which way it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burgess&quot;&gt;Burgess, 1978, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; (Hemingway, for his part, would quote this line in &quot;[[The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]&quot;, one of his famous short stories set in Africa.) To another soldier, Hemingway once said, &quot;You are ''troppo vecchio'' (''[[Italian (language)|It.]]'' too old) for this war, pop.&quot; The 50-year old soldier replied, &quot;I can die as well as any man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burgess&quot;/&gt;

On July 8, 1918, Hemingway was wounded delivering supplies to soldiers, which ended his career as an ambulance driver. He was hit by an Austrian [[trench warfare|trench]] [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] shell that left fragments in his legs, and was also hit by a burst of machine-gun fire. He was later awarded the [[Silver Medal of Military Valor]] (''medaglia d'argento'') from the Italian government for dragging a wounded Italian soldier to safety in spite of his own injuries. He was credited as the first American wounded in Italy during WWI by newspapers at the time but there is debate surrounding the veracity of this claim&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Hemingway+Archive/Online+Resources/eh_storyteller+Page+3.htm John F. Kennedy Presidential Library Online Resources: Ernest Hemingway: A Storyteller's Legacy]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Hemingway received treatment in a Milan hospital run by the [[American Red Cross]]. With very little in the way of entertainment, he often drank heavily and read newspapers to pass the time. Here he met [[Agnes von Kurowsky]] of Washington, D.C., one of eighteen nurses attending groups of four patients each, who was more than six years his senior. Hemingway fell in love with her, but their relationship did not survive his return to the United States; instead of following Hemingway to America, as originally planned, she became romantically involved with an Italian officer. This left an indelible mark on his psyche and provided inspiration for, and was fictionalized in, one of his early novels, ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]''. Hemingway's first story based on this relationship, &quot;A Very Short Story,&quot; appeared in 1925. &lt;!--Later in life, Hemingway identified even more closely with the protagonist of that novel, claiming (falsely) to have attained the rank of Lieutenant in the Italian Army and to have fought in three battles.-Ferguson, ''Pity of War'', xxiv.--&gt;

==First novels==
[[Image:Apt1239-2 002.jpg|thumb|Hemingway's 1921 apartment at 1239 North Dearborn, [[Chicago]]]]
After the war, Hemingway returned to Oak Park,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Putnam, Thomas |title=Hemingway on War and Its Aftermath |url=http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2006/spring/hemingway.html |accessdate=2008-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1920, he moved to an apartment on 1599 [[Bathurst Street]], now known as ''The Hemingway'', in the [[Humewood-Cedarvale]] neighborhood in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/specials/posthomes/story.html?id=413f4f0b-707e-4cac-a142-55e1b1732941 A National Post article on Toronto's Humewood-Cedarvale neighborhood]&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay, he found a job with the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' newspaper. He worked as a freelancer, staff writer, and [[foreign correspondent]]. Hemingway befriended fellow ''Star'' reporter [[Morley Callaghan]]. Callaghan had begun writing short stories at this time; he showed them to Hemingway, who praised them as fine work. They would later be reunited in Paris.

For a short time from late 1920 through most of 1921, Hemingway lived on the near north side of Chicago, while still filing stories for ''The Toronto Star''. He also worked as associate editor of the ''Co-operative Commonwealth'', a monthly journal. On September 3, 1921, Hemingway married his first wife, [[Hadley Richardson]]. After the [[honeymoon]] they moved to a cramped top floor apartment on the 1300 block of [[Clark Street (Chicago)|Clark Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Alan, &quot;Literary Landmarks of Chicago,&quot; 2004, Starhill Press, ISBN 0-913515-50-7.&lt;/ref&gt; In September, they moved to a cramped fourth floor apartment (3rd floor by Chicago building standard) at 1239 North Dearborn in a then run-down section of Chicago's near north side. The building still stands with a plaque on the front of it calling it &quot;The Hemingway Apartment.&quot; Hadley found it dark and depressing, but in December, 1921, the Hemingways left Chicago and Oak Park, never to live there again, and moved abroad.

On the advice of [[Sherwood Anderson]], they settled in Paris, France, where Hemingway covered the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] for the ''Toronto Star''. Anderson gave him a letter of introduction to [[Gertrude Stein]]. She became his mentor and introduced him to the &quot;Parisian Modern Movement&quot; then ongoing in the [[Montparnasse Quarter]]; this was the beginning of the American expatriate circle that became known as the &quot;[[Lost Generation]]&quot;, a term popularized by Hemingway in the epigraph to his novel, ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'', and his memoir, ''[[A Moveable Feast]]''. The epithet, &quot;Lost Generation&quot; was reportedly appropriated by Miss Stein from her French garage mechanic when he made the offhand comment that hers was &quot;une génération perdue&quot;. (&quot;'That's what you are. That's what you all are,' Miss Stein said. 'All of you young people who served in the war. You are a lost generation.'&quot; -- from Hemingway's posthumous memoir, ''[[A Moveable Feast]]''.) His other influential mentor was [[Ezra Pound]],&lt;ref&gt;On August 10, 1943, Hemingway typed a letter to Archibald MacLeish discussing Pound's mental health and other literary matters.&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of [[imagism]]. Hemingway later said of this eclectic group, &quot;Ezra was right half the time, and when he was wrong, he was so wrong you were never in any doubt about it. Gertrude was always right.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In a conversation with [[John Peale Bishop]], quoted in Hemingway, Cowley, ed, 1944, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The group often frequented [[Sylvia Beach]]'s bookshop, Shakespeare &amp; Co., at 12 ''Rue de l'Odéon''. After the 1922 publication and American banning of colleague [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', Hemingway used Toronto-based friends to smuggle copies of the novel into the United States (Hemingway writes of meeting and talking with Joyce in Paris in ''[[A Movable Feast]]''). His own first book, called ''Three Stories and Ten Poems'' (1923), was published in Paris by [[Robert McAlmon]].

After much success as a foreign correspondent, Hemingway returned to Toronto, Canada in 1923 writing under the [[pseudonym]] of '''Peter Jackson'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/470247|title=Hemingway feared for High Park's great trees|last=Jackson|first=Peter|coauthors=better known as Ernest Hemingway|date=2008-07-31|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his second stint living in Toronto, Hemingway's first son was born. He was named [[John Hadley Nicanor Hemingway]], but would later be known as Jack. Hemingway asked Gertrude Stein to be Jack's [[godparent|godmother]].

Around the same time, Hemingway had a bitter falling out with his editor, Harry Hindmarsh, who believed Hemingway had been spoiled by his time overseas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foreword&quot;&gt;''Dateline: Toronto'', Foreword, pp xxv-xxvii, Charles Scribner Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; Hindmarsh gave Hemingway mundane assignments, and Hemingway grew bitter and wrote an angry resignation in December 1923. However, his resignation was either ignored or rescinded, and Hemingway continued to write sporadically for ''The Toronto Star'' through 1924.&lt;ref name=&quot;Star&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title = Hem and The Star: Parting was inevitable|work = [[The Toronto Star]]|date=1986-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Hemingway's work for the Star was later published in the 1985 collection [[Dateline: Toronto]].

Hemingway's American literary debut came with the publication of the short story cycle ''[[In Our Time (book)|In Our Time]]'' (1925). The vignettes that now constitute the interchapters of the American version were initially published in Europe as ''in our time'' (1924). This work was important for Hemingway, reaffirming to him that his minimalist style could be accepted by the literary community. &quot;[[Big Two-Hearted River]]&quot; is the collection's best-known story.

In April 1925, two weeks after the publication of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', Hemingway met [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] at the [[Dingo Bar]]. Fitzgerald and Hemingway were at first close friends, often drinking and talking together. They sometimes exchanged manuscripts, and Fitzgerald did much to try to advance Hemingway's career and the publication of his first collections of stories.

[[Image:LaCloseriedesLilas.jpg|left|thumb|275px|''La Closerie des Lilas'' restaurant (1909 photo), where Hemingway wrote parts of ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'']]
Hemingway's relationships in France provided inspiration for Hemingway's first full-length novel, ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'' (1926) (published in the UK under the title &quot;Fiesta&quot;). The novel was semi-autobiographical, following a group of expatriate Americans around Paris and Spain. The climactic scenes of the novel are set in Pamplona, during the fiesta that the novel made famous throughout Europe and the U.S. The novel was a success and met with critical acclaim. While Hemingway had initially claimed that the novel was an obsolete form of literature, he was apparently inspired to write it after reading Fitzgerald's manuscript for ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

Hemingway divorced Hadley Richardson in 1927 and married [[Pauline Pfeiffer]], a devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] from [[Piggott, Arkansas]]. Pfeiffer was an occasional fashion reporter, publishing in magazines such as ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostgeneration.com/paris.htm Hemingway Resource Center] &lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway converted to Catholicism himself at this time. That year saw the publication of ''[[Men Without Women]]'', a collection of [[short story|short stories]], containing ''[[The Killers (short story)|The Killers]]'', one of Hemingway's best-known and most-anthologized stories. In 1928, Hemingway and Pfeiffer moved to [[Key West]], [[Florida]], to begin their new life together. However, their new life was soon interrupted by yet another tragic event in Hemingway's life.

In 1928, Hemingway's father, Clarence, troubled with [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and financial instabilities, committed suicide using an old [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[pistol]]. This greatly hurt Hemingway and is perhaps played out through Robert Jordan's father's suicide in the novel ''For Whom the Bell Tolls''. He immediately traveled to Oak Park to arrange the funeral and stirred up controversy by vocalizing what he thought to be the Catholic view, that suicides go to hell. At about the same time, [[Harry Crosby]], founder of the [[Black Sun Press]] and a friend of Hemingway's from his days in Paris, also committed suicide.[[Image:Hemingway House-Piggott.jpg|thumb|150px|The Hemingway-Pfeiffer House, built in 1927]] In that same year, Hemingway's second son, Patrick, was born in Kansas City (his third son, [[Gregory Hemingway|Gregory]], would be born to the couple a few years later). It was a [[Caesarean section|Caesarean]] birth after difficult labor, details of which were incorporated into the concluding scene of ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]''. Hemingway lived and wrote most of ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' plus several short stories at Pauline's parents' house in [[Piggott, Arkansas]]. The [[Pfeiffer House and Carriage House]] has since been converted into a museum owned by [[Arkansas State University]].

Published in 1929, ''A Farewell to Arms'' recounts the romance between [[Frederic Henry]], an American soldier, and Catherine Barkley, a British [[nurse]]. The novel is heavily autobiographical: the plot was directly inspired by his relationship with [[Agnes von Kurowsky]] in Milan; Catherine's [[parturition]] was inspired by the intense labor pains of Pauline in the birth of Patrick; the real-life [[Kathleen Eaton Cannell|Kitty Cannell]] inspired the fictional Helen Ferguson; the priest was based on Don Giuseppe Bianchi, the priest of the 69th and 70th regiments of the Brigata Ancona. While the inspiration of the character Rinaldi is obscure, he had already appeared in ''In Our Time''. ''A Farewell to Arms'' was published at a time when many other World War I books were prominent, including [[Frederic Manning]]'s ''[[Her Privates We]]'', [[Erich Maria Remarque]]'s ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', [[Richard Aldington]]'s ''[[Death of a Hero]]'', and [[Robert Graves]]' ''[[Goodbye to All That]]''. The success of ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' made Hemingway financially independent.

==Key West==
Following the advice of [[John Dos Passos]], Hemingway returned to [[Key West, Florida]] in 1931, where he established [[Ernest Hemingway House|his first American home]], which has since been converted to a museum. From this 1851 solid limestone house &amp;mdash; a wedding present from Pauline's uncle &amp;mdash; Hemingway fished in the waters around the [[Dry Tortugas]] with his longtime friend [[Waldo Pierce]], went to the famous bar [[Sloppy Joe's (bar)|Sloppy Joe's]], and occasionally traveled to Spain, gathering material for ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'' and ''[[Winner Take Nothing]]''. Over the next 9 years, until the end of this marriage in 1940, and then in a second period throughout the 1950s, Hemingway would do an estimated 70% of his lifetime's writing in the writer's den in the upper floor of the converted garage, in back of this house.

[[Image:Hemingwayhouse.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Ernest Hemingway House]] on [[Key West]]]]
''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'', a book about [[bullfighting]], was published in 1932. Hemingway had become an aficionado after seeing the [[Pamplona]] fiesta of 1925, fictionalized in ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]''. In ''Death in the Afternoon'', Hemingway extensively discussed the metaphysics of bullfighting: the ritualized, almost religious practice. Hemingway considered becoming a bullfighter himself and showed middling aptitude in several novieros before deciding that writing was his true and only suitable professional metier. In his writings on Spain, he was influenced by the Spanish master [[Pío Baroja]]. When Hemingway won the Nobel Prize, he traveled to see Baroja, then on his death bed, specifically to tell him he thought Baroja deserved the prize more than he. Baroja agreed and something of the usual Hemingway tiff with another writer ensued despite his original good intentions.

A [[safari]] in the fall of 1933 led him to [[Mombasa]], [[Nairobi]], and [[Machakos]] in [[Kenya]], moving on to Tanzania, where he hunted in the [[Serengeti]], around [[Lake Manyara]] and west and southeast of the present-day [[Tarangire National Park]]. 1935 saw the publication of ''Green Hills of Africa'', an account of his safari. ''[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]'' and ''[[The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]'' were the fictionalized results of his African experiences. Hemingway fell ill on this trip, suffering a prolapsed intestine.

==Spanish Civil War==
In 1937, Hemingway traveled to Spain in order to report on the [[Spanish Civil War]] for the North American Newspaper Alliance. While there, Hemingway broke his friendship with [[John Dos Passos]] because, despite warnings, Dos Passos continued to report on the atrocities of not only the fascist Nationalists whom Hemingway disliked, but also those of the elected and radicalized left-leaning Republicans whom he favored; characteristically, Hemingway spread a story that Dos Passos had fled Spain out of cowardice.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Breaking Point: Hemingway, Dos Passos, and the Murder of Jose Robles]]'' by [[Stephen Koch]], published 2005 ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;bhjakt&quot;&gt;''The Spanish Civil War'' (1961) by [[Hugh Thomas (historian)|Hugh Thomas]]&lt;/ref&gt; In this context Hemingway's colleague and associate [[Herbert Matthews]], who would become more well known for his favorable reports on [[Fidel Castro]], showed a similar predilection for the Republican side as Hemingway. Hemingway, who was a convert to Catholicism during his marriage to his wife Pauline, began to question his religion at this time, eventually leaving the church (though friends indicate that he had &quot;funny ties&quot; to Catholicism for the rest of his life). The war also strained Hemingway's marriage. Pauline Pfieffer was a devout Catholic and, as such, sided with the fascist, pro-Catholic regime of Franco, whereas Hemingway mostly supported the Republican government, for all his criticisms of it. During this time, Hemingway wrote a little known essay, ''The Denunciation'', which would not be published until 1969 within a collection of stories, the ''Fifth Column and Four Stories of the Spanish Civil War''. The story seems autobiographical, suggesting that Hemingway might have been an informant for the Republic as well as a weapons instructor during the war.&lt;ref name = &quot;bhjakt&quot;/&gt;

Some health problems characterized this period of Hemingway's life: an [[anthrax disease|anthrax]] infection, a cut eyeball, a gash in his forehead, [[grippe]], toothache, [[hemorrhoids]], [[kidney]] trouble from fishing, torn [[groin]] muscle, finger gashed to the bone in an accident with a punching ball, [[lacerations]] (to arms, legs, and face) from a ride on a runaway horse through a deep [[Wyoming]] forest, and a broken arm from a car accident.

==''Forty-Nine Stories''==
[[Image:Heming Way.jpg|thumb|Walkway named for Ernest Hemingway, [[Ronda]], Spain]]
In 1938&amp;mdash;along with his only full-length play, titled ''The Fifth Column''&amp;mdash;49 stories were published in the collection ''[[The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories]]''. Hemingway's intention was, as he openly stated in his foreword, to write more. Many of the stories that make up this collection can be found in other abridged collections, including ''[[In Our Time (book)|In Our Time]],'' ''[[Men Without Women]],'' ''[[Winner Take Nothing]],'' and ''[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]''.

Some of the collection's important stories include ''Old Man at the Bridge'', ''On The Quai at Smyrna'', ''[[Hills Like White Elephants]]'', ''One Reader Writes'', ''The Killers'' and (perhaps most famously) ''[[A Clean, Well-Lighted Place]]''. While these stories are rather short, the book also includes much longer stories, among them ''[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]'' and ''[[The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]''.

==''For Whom the Bell Tolls''==
{{main|For Whom the Bell Tolls}}
[[Image:Heminguey.jpg|thumb|left|Hemingway]]
In the spring of 1939, [[Francisco Franco]] and the Nationalists defeated the Republicans, ending the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Hemingway lost an adopted homeland to Franco's fascists, and would later lose his beloved [[Key West, Florida]], home due to his 1940 divorce. 

A few weeks after the divorce, he married his companion of four years in Spain, [[Martha Gellhorn]], his third wife. 

His novel ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' was published in 1940. It was written in 1939 in Cuba and Key West, and was finished in July 1940. The long work, which is set during the Spanish Civil War, was based on real events and tells of an American named Robert Jordan fighting with Spanish soldiers on the Republican side. It was largely based on Hemingway's experience of living in Spain and reporting on the war. It is one of his most notable literary accomplishments. The title is taken from the penultimate paragraph of [[John Donne]]'s ''[[Meditation XVII]]''.

==World War II and after==
The United States entered [[World War II]] on December 8, 1941, and for the first time in his life, Hemingway sought to take part in naval warfare. Aboard the ''Pilar'', now a [[Q-Ship]], Hemingway's crew was charged with sinking German [[submarine]]s threatening shipping off the coasts of [[Cuba]] and the United States. After the [[FBI]] took over Caribbean counter-espionage, he went to Europe as a war correspondent for ''[[Collier's]]'' magazine. There Hemingway observed the [[D-Day]] landings from an LCVP (landing craft), although he was not allowed to go ashore. He later became angry that his wife, Martha Gellhorn &amp;mdash; by then, more a rival war correspondent than a wife &amp;mdash; had managed to get ashore in the early hours of June 7 dressed as a nurse, after she had crossed the Atlantic to England in a ship loaded with explosives. Hemingway acted as an unofficial liaison officer at [[Château de Rambouillet]], and afterwards formed his own partisan group which, as he later wrote, took part in the liberation of [[Paris]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} Although this claim has been challenged by many historians, he was nevertheless unquestionably on the scene.&lt;ref&gt;''[[How It Was: An Autobiography]]'' by [[Mary Welsh Hemingway]], copyright 1976, ISBN 0345254325&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been purported that while traveling to the front he threw a hand grenade into a basement room full of German field grade officers despite his official non-combatant role. {{Fact|date=May 2008}}

After the war, Hemingway started work on ''[[The Garden of Eden]]'', which was never finished and would be published posthumously in a much-abridged form in 1986. At one stage, he planned a major trilogy which was to comprise &quot;The Sea When Young&quot;, &quot;The Sea When Absent&quot; and &quot;The Sea in Being&quot; (the latter eventually published in 1952 as ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''). He spent time in a small Italian town called [[Acciaroli]] (located approximately 136 km south of [[Naples]]). There was also a &quot;Sea-Chase&quot; story; three of these pieces were edited and stuck together as the posthumously-published novel ''[[Islands in the Stream (Hemingway)|Islands in the Stream]]'' (1970).

Newly divorced from Gellhorn after four contentious years, Hemingway married war correspondent [[Mary Welsh Hemingway]], whom he had met overseas in 1944. He returned to Cuba, and in 1945 at the Soviet Embassy became public witness to the [[Rolando Masferrer]] schism within the Cuban communist party (García Montes, and Alonso Ávila, 1970 p. 362).

Hemingway's first novel after ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' was ''[[Across the River and into the Trees]]'' (1950), set in post-World War II [[Venice]]. He derived the title from the last words of [[American Civil War]] Confederate General [[Thomas J. Jackson|Stonewall Jackson]]. Enamored of a young Italian girl ([[Adriana Ivancich]]) at the time, Hemingway wrote ''Across the River and into the Trees'' as a romance between a war-weary Colonel Cantwell (based on his friend, then Colonel [[Major General Charles T. Lanham|Charles Lanham]]) and the young Renata (clearly based on Adriana; &quot;Renata&quot; has an assonance with &quot;rinata&quot;, meaning &quot;reborn&quot; in Italian). The novel received largely bad reviews, many of which accused Hemingway of tastelessness, stylistic ineptitude, and sentimentality; however this criticism was not shared by all critics.

==Later years==
[[Image:Ernest Hemingway 1950.jpg|thumb|Aboard his yacht, the Pilar, ca. mid 1950s]]
One section of the sea trilogy was published as ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' in 1952. That [[novella]]'s great success, both commercial and critical, satisfied and fulfilled Hemingway. It earned him the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1953. The next year he was awarded with the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Upon receiving the latter he noted that he would have been &quot;happy; happier...if the prize had been given to that beautiful writer [[Isak Dinesen]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;From ''The New York Times Book Review, November 7, 1954''.&lt;/ref&gt; These awards helped to restore his international reputation.

Then, his legendary bad luck{{fact|date=July 2008}} struck once again; on a safari, he was seriously injured in two successive plane crashes; he sprained his right shoulder, arm, and left leg, had a grave [[concussion]], temporarily lost vision in his left eye and the hearing in his left ear, suffered paralysis of the spine, a crushed [[vertebra]], ruptured liver, spleen and kidney, and first degree burns on his face, arms, and leg. Some American newspapers mistakenly published his obituary, thinking he had been killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_461577223/Ernest_Hemingway_Quick_Facts.html|title=Ernest Hemingway Quick Facts|publisher=[[encarta]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemingway was then badly injured one month later in a [[bushfire]] accident, which left him with second degree burns on his legs, front torso, lips, left hand and right forearm. The pain left him in prolonged anguish, and he was unable to travel to [[Stockholm]] to accept his Nobel Prize.

A glimmer of hope came with the discovery of some of his old manuscripts from 1928 in the Ritz cellars, which were transformed into ''[[A Moveable Feast]]''. Although some of his energy seemed to be restored, severe drinking problems kept him down. His [[blood pressure]] and [[cholesterol]] were perilously high, he suffered from aortal inflammation, and his [[depression (mood)|depression]] was aggravated by his [[dipsomania]]. However, in October 1956, Hemingway found the strength to travel to Madrid and act as a pallbearer at [[Pío Baroja]]'s burial. Baroja was one of Hemingway's literary influences.

Following the [[Cuban Revolution|revolution in Cuba]] and the ousting of General [[Fulgencio Batista]] in 1959, [[expropriation]]s of foreign owned property led many Americans to return to the United States. Hemingway chose to stay a little longer. It is commonly said that he maintained good relations with [[Fidel Castro]] and declared his support for the revolution, and he is quoted as wishing Castro &quot;all luck&quot; with running the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://www.ernest.hemingway.com/marywelsh.htm|title=Hemingway's Marriage to Mary Welsh.

According to this account Castro is captured in the company of a woman and child as he tries to flee to Venezuela via the Cuban airport of Rancho Boyeros south of Havana by the Cuban Bureau of Investigation as witnessed by sergeant of that organization Joaquin Tasas. Castro is released the next day. This matter is a little odd since Fidel Castro was believed to have organized the death of Manolo Castro (p. 99). This version is a close fit the scenario described in &quot;The Shot/.&quot; &lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway came under surveillance by the [[FBI]] both during World War II and afterwards (most probably because of his long association with marxist Spanish Civil War veterans&lt;ref&gt;The Breaking Point: Hemingway, Dos Passos, and the Murder of Jose Robles by Stephen Koch, published 2005 ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; who were again active in Cuba) for his residence and activities in Cuba.&lt;ref name=&quot;eh&quot;&gt;[http://www.ernest.hemingway.com/cuba.htm Ernest Hemingway His Life and Works&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, he left the island and [[Finca Vigía]], his estate outside [[Havana]], that he owned for over twenty years.

In February 1960, Ernest Hemingway was unable to get his bullfighting narrative ''[[The Dangerous Summer]]'' to the publishers. He therefore had his wife Mary summon his friend, ''[[Life Magazine]]'' bureau head [[Will Lang Jr.]], to leave Paris and come to Spain. Hemingway persuaded Lang to let him print the manuscript, along with a picture layout, before it came out in hardcover. Although not a word of it was on paper, the proposal was agreed upon. The first part of the story appeared in ''Life Magazine'' on September 5, 1960, with the remaining installments being printed in successive issues.

Hemingway was upset by the photographs in his ''The Dangerous Summer'' article. He was receiving treatment in [[Ketchum, Idaho]] for high blood pressure and liver problems &amp;mdash; and also [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) for [[clinical depression|depression]] and continued paranoia, although this may in fact have helped to precipitate his suicide, since he reportedly suffered significant memory loss as a result of the shock treatments. He also lost weight, his 6-foot (183 cm) frame appearing gaunt at 170 pounds (77 kg, 12st 2lb).

==Suicide==
[[Image:Ernest Hemingway001.JPG|thumb|Hemingway]]
Hemingway attempted suicide in the spring of 1961, and received [[Electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]] treatment again. On the morning of July 2, 1961, some three weeks short of his 62nd birthday, he died at his home in [[Ketchum, Idaho]], the result of a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head. Judged not mentally responsible for his final act, he was buried in a Roman Catholic service. Hemingway himself blamed the ECT treatments for &quot;putting him out of business&quot; by destroying his memory; some medical and scholarly opinion has been receptive to this view, although others, including one of the physicians who prescribed the electroshock regimen, dispute that opinion.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Hemingway is believed to have purchased the [[Boss &amp; Co.]] shotgun he used to commit suicide through [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]], which was then an elite excursion goods retailer and firearm supplier.&lt;ref&gt;Grauer, Neil A. &quot;Remembering Papa.&quot; ''Cigar Aficionado'', July/August 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In a particularly gruesome suicide, he rested the gun butt of the double-barreled shotgun on the floor of a hallway in his home, leaned over it to put the twin muzzles to his forehead just above the eyes, and pulled both triggers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/04/specials/hemingway-summer.html The Last Ole&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The coroner, at request of the family, did not do an autopsy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wais.stanford.edu/Spain/spain_hemingway0799.html Ernest Hemingway]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other members of Hemingway's immediate family also committed [[suicide]], including his father, Clarence Hemingway, his siblings Ursula and Leicester, and possibly his granddaughter [[Margaux Hemingway]]. Some believe that certain members of Hemingway's paternal line had a hereditary disease known as [[haemochromatosis]] (bronze diabetes), in which an excess of iron concentration in the blood causes damage to the [[pancreas]] and also causes depression or instability in the cerebrum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagner-Martin&quot;&gt;(Wagner-Martin, 2000) p.43 describes his condition in August 1947 as including high blood pressure, [[diabetes]], depression and possible [[haemochromatosis]].&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway's father is known to have developed haemochromatosis in the years prior to his suicide at age fifty-nine. Throughout his life, Hemingway had been a heavy drinker, succumbing to [[alcoholism]] in his later years.

Hemingway possibly suffered from [[manic depression]], and was subsequently treated with [[electroshock therapy]] at [[Menninger Clinic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Hemingway is interred in the town cemetery in [[Ketchum, Idaho]], at the north end of town. A memorial was erected in 1966 at another location, overlooking Trail Creek, north of Ketchum. It is inscribed with a eulogy he wrote for a friend, Gene Van Guilder:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Best of all he loved the fall
The leaves yellow on the cottonwoods
Leaves floating on the trout streams
And above the hills
The high blue windless skies
Now he will be a part of them forever

&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Celebrating Hemingway's love for Idaho and the frontier, The Ernest Hemingway Festival&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ernesthemingwayfestival.org&lt;/ref&gt; takes place annually in Ketchum and Sun Valley in late September with scholars, a reading by the PEN/Hemingway Award winner and many more events, including historical tours, open mic nights and a sponsored dinner at Hemingway's home in Warm Springs now maintained by the Nature Conservancy in Ketchum.

==Posthumous works==
Hemingway was a prolific letter writer and, in 1981, many of these were published by [[Charles Scribner|Scribner]] in ''[[Ernest Hemingway Selected Letters]]''. It was met with some controversy as Hemingway himself stated he never wished to publish his letters. Further letters were published in a book of his correspondence with his editor Max Perkins, ''The Only Thing that Counts'' [1996].

A long-term project is now underway to publish the thousands of letters Hemingway wrote during his lifetime. The project is being undertaken as a joint venture by [[Penn State University]] and the [[Ernest Hemingway Foundation]]. Sandra Spanier, Professor of English and wife of [[Penn State]] president [[Graham Spanier]], is serving as general editor of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psu.edu/ur/archives/intercom_2002/May9/hemingway.html hemingwayx.html&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemingway was still writing up to his death; most of the [[unfinished work]]s which were Hemingway's sole creation have been published posthumously; they are ''[[A Moveable Feast]],'' ''[[Islands in the Stream (Hemingway)|Islands in the Stream]],'' ''[[The Nick Adams Stories]]'' (portions of which were previously unpublished), ''[[The Dangerous Summer]],'' and ''[[The Garden of Eden]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Information about these posthumous Hemingway works was taken from Charles Scribner, Jr.'s 1987 Preface to ''The Garden of Eden''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a note forwarding &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;, Mary Hemingway indicated that she worked with Charles Scribner, Jr. on &quot;preparing this book for publication from Ernest's original manuscript&quot;. She also stated that &quot;beyond the routine chores of correcting spelling and punctuation, we made some cuts in the manuscript, I feel that Ernest would surely have made them himself. The book is all Ernest's. We have added nothing to it.&quot; Some controversy has surrounded the publication of these works, insofar as it has been suggested that it is not necessarily within the jurisdiction of Hemingway's relatives or publishers to determine whether these works should be made available to the public. For example, scholars often disapprovingly note that the version of ''The Garden of Eden'' published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] in 1986, though in no way a revision of Hemingway's original words, nonetheless omits two-thirds of the original manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/shortguide-garden_of_eden/ BookRags] makes this quantitative note; it also reveals some more information about the publication of ''The Garden of Eden'' and offers some discussion of thematic content.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Nick Adams Stories]]'' appeared posthumously in 1972. What is now considered the definitive compilation of all of Hemingway's short stories was published as ''[[The Complete Short Stories Of Ernest Hemingway]],'' first compiled and published in 1987. As well, in 1969 ''The Fifth Column and Four Stories Of The Spanish Civil War'' was published. It contains Hemingway's only full length play, ''The Fifth Column'', which was previously published along with the ''First Forty-Nine Stories'' in 1938, along with four unpublished works written about Hemingway's experiences during the Spanish Civil War.

In 1999, another novel entitled ''[[True at First Light]]'' appeared under the name of Ernest Hemingway, though it was heavily edited by his son [[Patrick Hemingway]]. Six years later, ''[[Under Kilimanjaro]],'' a re-edited and considerably longer version of ''[[True at First Light]]'' appeared. In either edition, the novel is a fictional account of Hemingway's final African safari in 1953—1954. He spent several months in Kenya with his fourth wife, Mary, before his near-fatal plane crashes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://upress.kent.edu/books/Hemingway.htm The Kent State University Press] is the official source for this new novel's release.&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipation of the novel, whose manuscript was completed in 1956, adumbrates perhaps an unprecedentedly large critical battle over whether it is proper to publish the work (many sources mention that a new, light side of Hemingway will be seen as opposed to his canonical, macho image&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.und.edu/dept/our/dimensions/march2005/2.html University of North Dakota] feature of editor Robert W. Lewis, for example.&lt;/ref&gt;), even as editors [[Robert W. Lewis]] of [[University of North Dakota]] and [[Robert E. Fleming]] of [[University of New Mexico]] have pushed it through to publication; the novel was published on September 15, 2005.

Also published posthumously were several collections of his work as a journalist. These contain his columns and articles for Esquire Magazine, The North American Newspaper Alliance, and the Toronto ''Star''; they include ''Byline: Ernest Hemingway'' edited by William White, and ''Hemingway: The Wild Years'' edited by Gene Z. Hanrahan. Finally, a collection of introductions, forwards, public letters and other miscellanea was published as ''Hemingway and the Mechanism of Fame'' in 2005.

==Influence and legacy==
The influence of Hemingway's writings on [[American literature]] was considerable and continues today. [[James Joyce]] called &quot;A Clean, Well Lighted Place&quot; &quot;one of the best stories ever written&quot;. (The same story also influenced several of [[Edward Hopper]]'s best known paintings, most notably &quot;[[Nighthawks]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Walter, '''Silent Theater: The Art of Edward Hopper''', London/New York: Phaidon, 2007 &lt;/ref&gt; ) [[Pulp magazine|Pulp fiction]] and &quot;[[hardboiled|hard boiled]]&quot; crime fiction (which flourished from the 1920s to the 1950s) often owed a strong debt to Hemingway. 

During World War II, [[J. D. Salinger]] met and corresponded with Hemingway, whom he acknowledged as an influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lamb|first=Robert Paul|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0403/is_n4_v42/ai_20119140/pg_17|title=Hemingway and the creation of twentieth-century dialogue - American author Ernest Hemingway|publisher=Twentieth Century Literature|date=Winter 1996|accessdate=2007-07-10|format=reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one letter to Hemingway, Salinger wrote that their talks &quot;had given him his only hopeful minutes of the entire war,&quot; and jokingly &quot;named himself national chairman of the Hemingway Fan Clubs.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;baker&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Carlos|authorlink=Carlos Baker|coauthors=|title=Ernest Hemingway: A Life Story|year=1969|publisher=Charles Scribner’s Sons|location=New York|id=ISBN 0-020-01690-5}} p. 420, 646.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Hunter S. Thompson]] often compared himself to Hemingway, and terse Hemingway-esque sentences can be found in his early novel, ''[[The Rum Diary (novel)|The Rum Diary]]''. Thompson's later suicide by gunshot to the head mirrored Hemingway's. 

Hemingway's terse prose style--&quot;Nick stood up. He was all right.&quot;-- is known to have inspired [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Chuck Palahniuk]], [[Douglas Coupland]] and many [[Generation X]] writers. Hemingway's style also influenced [[Jack Kerouac]] and other [[Beat Generation]] writers. Hemingway also provided a role model to fellow author and hunter [[Robert Ruark]], who is frequently referred to as &quot;the poor man's Ernest Hemingway&quot;. 

Popular novelist [[Elmore Leonard]], who has authored scores of western- and crime-genre novels, cites Hemingway as his preeminent influence, and this is evident in his tightly written prose. Though Leonard has never claimed to write serious literature, he has said: &quot;I learned by imitating Hemingway.... until I realized that I didn't share his attitude about life. I didn't take myself or anything as seriously as he did.&quot;

==Tributes==
[[Image:Ehmercury.jpg|thumb|''[[The American Mercury]]'' with [[Al Hirschfeld]]'s caricature of Ernest Hemingway]]
* Hemingway is the implied subject of the [[Ray Bradbury]] story ''The Kilimanjaro Device''. Using the plot device of a time machine, the tale creates a loving tribute that undoes his suicide. The story appears in the Bradbury collection ''I Sing The Body Electric''.
* In 1999, [[Michael Palin]] retraced the footsteps of Hemingway, in ''[[Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure]]'', a [[BBC]] television documentary, one hundred years after the birth of his favorite writer. The journey took him through many sites including [[Chicago]], [[Paris]], Italy, Africa, [[Key West]], [[Cuba]], and [[Idaho]]. Together with photographer [[Basil Pao]], Palin also created a [[Hemingway Adventure (book)|book version of the trip]]. The text of the book is available for free on [http://www.palinstravels.co.uk/static-132 Palin's website].
* Since 1987, actor-writer [[Ed Metzger]] has portrayed the life of Ernest Hemingway in his one-man stage show, ''Hemingway: On The Edge'', featuring stories and anecdotes from Hemingway's own life and adventures. Metzger quotes Hemingway, &quot;My father told me never kill anything you're not going to eat. At the age of 9, I shot a porcupine. It was the toughest lesson I ever had.&quot; More information about the show is available at his [http://www.hemingwayplay.com/ website]
* Hemingway's World War II experiences in Cuba have been novelized by [[Dan Simmons]] as a spy thriller, ''[[The Crook Factory]]''.
* Hemingway, played by [[Jay Underwood]], was a recurring character in ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]''. In one episode, set in Northern Italy in 1916, Hemingway the ambulance driver gives [[Indiana Jones|young Indy]] ([[Sean Patrick Flanery]]) advice about women -- only to discover that he and Indy are rivals for the heart of the same woman. (The episode shows Indy unwittingly influencing Hemingway's future writing, by reciting the Elizabethan poem, ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' by [[George Peele]].) In another episode, set in Chicago in 1920, Hemingway the newspaper reporter helps Indy and a young [[Eliot Ness]] in their investigation of the murder of gangster [[James Colosimo]].
* The 1993 motion picture ''[[Wrestling Ernest Hemingway]]'', about the friendship of two retired men, one Irish, one Cuban, in a seaside town in Florida, starred [[Robert Duvall]], [[Richard Harris]], [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Sandra Bullock]], and [[Piper Laurie]].
* The 1996 motion picture ''[[In Love and War (1996 film)|In Love and War]]'', based on the book ''Hemingway in Love and War'' by Henry S. Villard and James Nagel, is the story of the young reporter Ernest Hemingway (played by [[Chris O'Donnell]]) as an ambulance driver in Italy during World War I. While bravely risking his life in the line of duty, he is injured and ends up in the hospital, where he falls in love with his nurse, Agnes von Kurowsky ([[Sandra Bullock]]).
* The Michigan Humanities Council directed a year long program, [http://www.greatmichiganread.org The Great Michigan Read], in 2007-2008. It selected the Ernest Hemingway short story collection, ''The Nick Adams Stories'', as the statewide read. It was the first known instance an organization had selected a Hemingway book for a statewide reading initiative.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}
* In the 1989 [[James Bond]] film ''[[Licence to Kill]]'', Bond (played by [[Timothy Dalton]]) meets with M at the Hemingway House. When asked for his gun after handing in his resignation, Bond exclaims &quot;I guess it's a Farewell To Arms&quot;, in reference to the work of the same name.
*[[Joyce Carol Oates]] wrote a loosely biographical short story of the last days of Hemingway called ''Papa at Ketchum, 1961'' in her 2008 book ''Wild Nights''.

==Anecdotes==
* In a boxing match with friend and writer [[Morley Callaghan]], Hemingway's lip was cut. Hemingway spit blood into Callaghan's face and said: &quot;The [[bullfighter]]s do that when they are injured, it is how they show contempt.&quot;{{Fact|date=May 2008}}
* In a letter to [[Ezra Pound]], Hemingway describes why bulls are better than literary critics: &quot;Bulls don't run reviews. Bulls of 25 don't marry old women of 55 and expect to be invited to dinner. Bulls do not get you cited as co-respondent in Society divorce trials. Bulls don't borrow money. Bulls are edible after they have been killed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/06/04/britain.letters.reut/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to various biographical sources, Hemingway was six feet tall and weighed anywhere between 170 and 260 pounds at varying times in his life. His build was muscular, though he became paunchy in his middle years. He had dark brown hair, brown eyes, and habitually wore a mustache (with an occasional beard) from the age of 23 on. By age 50, he consistently wore a graying beard. He had a scar on his forehead, the result of a drunken accident in Paris in his late 20s (thinking he was flushing a toilet, he accidentally pulled a skylight down on his head). He suffered from [[myopia]] all his life, but vanity prevented him from being fitted with glasses until he was 32 (and very rarely was he photographed wearing them). He was fond of [[tennis]] and [[boxing]], fonder of [[fishing]] and [[hunting]], and hated [[New York City]].{{Fact|date=May 2008}}
* Though Hemingway did not have a favorable opinion of his hometown of [[Oak Park, IL]], describing it as a town of &quot;Wide yards and narrow minds,&quot; the town has adopted a favorable opinion about him. Today a [http://www.ehfop.org/ Hemingway Museum] exists in that town. Every summer a Hemingway festival is staged in that city, complete with a &quot;running of the bulls&quot;, using a fake bull on wheels. This festival also features readings of the author's work and Spanish food.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}
* ''The original [[short short story]].'' In the 1920s, Hemingway bet his colleagues $10 that he could write a [[Flash fiction|complete story in just six words]]. They paid up. His story: &quot;For sale: Baby shoes, Never worn.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Clarke, &quot;Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds, Collected Essays&quot;, 1999, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; In a contest in Wired magazine inspired by Hemingway's story, 33 authors recently submitted 6-word efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/sixwords.html Wired 14.11: Very Short Stories&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hemingway's unique prose style spawned legions of imitators and many notable writers have attempted to satirize his style, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Truman Capote and George Plimpton. For thirty years an&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Imitation_Hemingway_Competition&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Imitation Hemingway Writing Contest]] was held and writers submitted the 'best bad Hemingway,' and two anthologies of 'The Best of Bad Hemingway' have been published.
* The film director [[Howard Hawks]] made a bet with Hemingway, saying that he could make a great film from what the author considered his worst book. The result was the classic [[To Have And Have Not]] (1944), with [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], although the film was only loosely based on Hemingway's original 1937 novel.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}
* Shine Forbes, a local Key West boxer was chosen to be a cornerman for an overmatched young boxer named Alfred &quot;Black Pie&quot; Colebrooks against Cuban boxer Joe Mills; none other than Ernest Hemingway was the referee for the match held at the Blue Goose Arena, now the backyard of the Blue Heaven restaurant. Shine was not aware of who Hemingway was at the time and reportedly thought he looked like a &quot;hippie.&quot; Inevitably, Shine attempted to throw in the towel for the doomed Colebrooks, but Hemingway repeatedly threw the towel back. Shine Forbes jumped into the ring and jumped to swing at Hemingway, only to land on his chest. Hemingway then lifted Forbes by the ears and shook him; police soon were on the scene to arrest Shine but Hemingway stopped them saying &quot;Don't arrest him. Any time a man's got guts enough to take a punch at me, he's alright.&quot; Shine Forbes apologized that day and became a close friend and sparring partner of Hemingway. Shine Forbes remained a regular at the Blue Heaven until his death in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/hemingwayadventure/boxing.html Boxing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Franklin''' ({{OldStyleDateDY|January 17,|1706|January 6, 1705&lt;!-- 1705 is correct. In Old Style, new year began March 25--&gt;}} {{ndash}} April 17, 1790) was one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] of the [[United States|United States of America]]. A noted [[polymath]], Franklin was a leading [[author]] and [[Printer (publisher)|printer]], [[Satire|satirist]], [[list of political philosophers|political theorist]], [[politician]], [[scientist]], [[inventor]], [[activism|civic activist]], [[statesman]] and [[diplomacy|diplomat]]. As a scientist he was a major figure in the [[American Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[history of physics]] for his discoveries and theories regarding [[electricity]]. He invented the [[lightning rod]], [[bifocals]], the [[Franklin stove]], a carriage [[odometer]], and [[glass harmonica#Benjamin Franklin's armonica|a musical instrument]].  He formed both the first [[public library|public lending library]] in America and first [[fire station|fire department]] in Pennsylvania. He was an early proponent of [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial unity]] and as a political writer and activist he, more than anyone, invented the idea of an American nation&lt;ref&gt;Block, Seymour Stanton. [http://www.historynet.com/exploration/science_engineering/3036996.html ''Benjamin Franklin: America's Inventor''] from HistoryNet.com&lt;/ref&gt; and as a diplomat during the [[American Revolution]], he secured the [[Franco-American relations|French alliance]] that helped to make independence possible.

Franklin is credited as being foundational to the roots of American values and character, a marriage of the practical and democratic [[Puritan]] values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment. In the words of [[Henry Steele Commager]], &quot;In Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects, the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Isaacson. ''Benjamin Franklin: An American Life'' p 491  (2003). &lt;/ref&gt; To Walter Isaacson, this makes Franklin, &quot;the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;ibid, p. 492 &lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin became a newspaper editor, printer, and merchant in [[Philadelphia]], becoming very wealthy, writing and publishing ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' and the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette (newspaper)|Pennsylvania Gazette]]''. Franklin was interested in science and technology, and gained international renown for his famous experiments. He played a major role in establishing the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]] and was elected the first president of the [[American Philosophical Society]]. Franklin became a [[hero|national hero]] in America when he spearheaded the effort to have [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] repeal the unpopular [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]]. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive [[Franco-American relations]]. From 1775 to 1776, Franklin was [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] under the [[Continental Congress]] and from 1785 to 1788 was [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Presidents of Council|President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania]]. Toward the end of his life, he became one of the most prominent [[abolitionism#United States|abolitionists]].

Franklin's colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers, has seen Franklin honored on coinage and money; warships; the names of many towns, counties, educational institutions, namesakes, and companies; and more than two centuries after his death, countless cultural references.

==Biography==
===Ancestry===
Franklin's father, [[Josiah Franklin]], was born at [[Ecton]], [[Northamptonshire]], England on December 23, 1657, the son of Thomas Franklin, a [[blacksmith]] and [[farmer]], and Jane White. His mother, Abiah Folger, was born in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]], on August 15, 1667, to Peter Folger, a miller and schoolteacher and his wife [[Mary Morrill]], a former [[indentured servant]]. A descendant of the Folgers, [[J.A. Folger]], founded [[Folgers]] Coffee in the 19th century.

Josiah Franklin had seventeen children by his two wives. His first wife was Anne Child, whom he married about 1677 in Ecton and immigrated to Boston with in 1683; they had three children before immigrating, and four after.  After her death, Josiah was married to Abiah Folger on July 9, 1689 in the [[Old South Meeting House]] by [[Samuel Willard]].  Benjamin, their eighth child, was Josiah Franklin's fifteenth child and tenth and last son.

Josiah Franklin converted to the [[Puritan]]ism in the 1670s.  Puritanism was a Protestant movement in England to &quot;purify&quot; [[Anglican]]ism from elements of the [[Roman Catholic]] religion, which they considered superstitious.  Three things were important to the Puritans:  that each congregation would be self-governing, that ministers give sermons instead of performing rituals such as a Mass and individual Bible study so that each believer could develop a personal understanding and relationship with God. Puritanism appealed to smart, middle-class people such as Benjamin Franklin's father, who enjoyed the governance meetings, discussion, study and personal independence.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, Walter. Benjamin Franklin, An American Life. (Simon &amp; Schuster 2003), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of American democracy can be seen in these Puritan values of self-government, the importance of the individual and active indignation against unjust authority, which were passed on to Benjamin Franklin and other founding fathers such as John Adams.  One of Josiah's core Puritan values was that personal worth is earned through hard work, which makes the industrious man the equal of kings, which Ben Franklin etched onto his father's tombstone, from his father Josiah's favorite Bible quote, from the Hebrew Bible, Proverbs 22:29: &quot;Seest thou a man diligent in his calling, he shall stand before Kings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;ibid, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Hard work and equality were two Puritan values Ben Franklin preached throughout his own life (ibid, p 78) and spread widely through Poor Richard's Almanac and his [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]].

Ben Franklin's mother, Abiah Folger, was born into a Puritan family that was among the first Pilgrims to flee to Massachusetts for religious freedom, when King [[Charles I of England]] began persecuting Protestants.  They sailed for Boston in 1635. Her father was &quot;the sort of rebel destined to transform colonial America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;ibid, p14&lt;/ref&gt; As clerk of the court, he was jailed for disobeying the local magistrate in defense of middle-class shopkeepers and artisans in conflict with wealthy landowners. Ben Franklin followed in his grandfather's footsteps in his battles against the wealthy Penn family that owned the [[Pennsylvania Colony]].

===Early life===
[[Image:Benjamin Franklin Birthplace.jpg|thumb|right|Franklin's Birthplace site directly across from [[Old South Meeting House]] on Milk Street is commemorated by a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] above the second floor facade of this building]]

Benjamin Franklin was born on Milk Street, in [[Boston]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], on January 17, 1706&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alumni.upenn.edu/club/benbday/birthdate.html ''The Story of Ben's Birthdate.''] University of Pennsylvania, alumni.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Infant baptism|baptized]] at Old South Meeting House. His father, Josiah Franklin, was a [[tallow]] chandler, a maker of candles and soap, whose second wife, Abiah Folger, was Benjamin's mother. Josiah's marriages produced 17 children; Benjamin was the fifteenth child and youngest son. Josiah wanted Ben to attend school with the clergy but only had enough money to send him to school for two years. He attended [[Boston Latin School]] but did not graduate; he continued his education through voracious reading. Although &quot;his parents talked of the church as a career&quot; for Franklin, his schooling ended when he was ten. He then worked for his father for a time and at 12 he became an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]] to his brother James, a printer, who taught Ben the printing trade. When Ben was 15, James created the ''[[New-England Courant|New England Courant]]'', [[History of American newspapers|the first truly independent newspaper in the colonies]]. When denied the option to write to the paper, Franklin invented the pseudonym of ''&quot;[[Mrs.]] [[Silence Dogood]],&quot;'' who was ostensibly a middle-aged widow. The letters were published in the paper and became a subject of conversation around town. Neither James nor the Courant's readers were aware of the ruse, and James was unhappy with Ben when he discovered the popular correspondent was his younger brother. Franklin left his apprenticeship without permission and in so doing became a fugitive.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;&gt;Van Doren, Carl. ''Benjamin Franklin''. (1938). Penguin reprint 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 17, Franklin ran away to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, seeking a new start in a new city. When he first arrived he worked in several printer shops around town. However, he was not satisfied by the immediate prospects. After a few months, while working in a printing house, Franklin was convinced by Pennsylvania Governor [[William Keith (Colonial Governor)|Sir William Keith]] to go to London, ostensibly to acquire the equipment necessary for establishing another newspaper in Philadelphia. Finding Keith's promises of backing a newspaper to be empty, Franklin worked as a [[compositing|compositor]] in a printer's shop in what is now the [[St Bartholomew-the-Great|Church of St Bartholomew-the-Great]] in the [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] area of London. Following this, he returned to Philadelphia in 1726 with the help of a merchant named Thomas Denham, who gave Franklin a position as clerk, shopkeeper, and bookkeeper in Denham's merchant business.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;

In 1727, Benjamin Franklin, 21, created the [[Junto]], a group of &quot;like minded aspiring artisans and tradesmen who hoped to improve themselves while they improved their community.&quot; The Junto was a discussion group for issues of the day; it subsequently gave rise to many organizations in Philadelphia.

Reading was a great pastime of the Junto, but books were rare and expensive. The members created a library, and initially pooled their own books together. This did not work, however, and Franklin initiated the idea of a subscription library, where the members pooled their monetary resources to buy books. This idea was the birth of the Library Company, with the charter of the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]] created in 1731 by Franklin. Franklin hired the first American librarian in 1732, [[Louis Timothee]]. 

Originally, the books were kept in the homes of the first librarians, but in 1739 the collection was moved to the second floor of the State House of Pennsylvania, now known as [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]]. In 1791, a new building was built specifically for the library.   The Library Company flourished with no competition and gained many priceless collections from bibliophiles such as James Logan and his physician brother William. The Library Company is now a great scholarly and research library with 500,000 rare books, pamphlets, and broadsides, more than 160,000 manuscripts, and 75,000 graphic items.

Upon Denham's death, Franklin returned to his former trade. By 1730, Franklin had set up a printing house of his own and had contrived to become the publisher of a newspaper called ''The Pennsylvania Gazette''. The Gazette gave Franklin a forum for agitation about a variety of local reforms and initiatives through printed essays and observations. Over time, his commentary, together with a great deal of savvy about cultivating a positive image of an industrious and intellectual young man, earned him a great deal of social respect; though even after Franklin had achieved fame as a scientist and statesman, he habitually signed his letters with the unpretentious 'B. Franklin, Printer.'&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;

In 1731, Franklin was initiated into the local [[freemasonry|Freemason]] lodge, becoming a grand master in 1734, indicating his rapid rise to prominence in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=HC&gt;[[The History Channel]], ''Mysteries of the Freemasons: America'', video documentary, August 1, 2006, written by Noah Nicholas and Molly Bedell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/franklin_b/franklin_b.html Freemasonry Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon website.]&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he edited and published the first Masonic book in the Americas, a reprint of James Anderson's [[Masonic manuscripts|Constitutions of the Free-Masons]]. Franklin remained a Freemason throughout the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Van Horne, John C. &quot;The History and Collections of the Library Company of Philadelphia,&quot; ''The Magazine Antiques'', v. 170. no. 2: 58-65 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lemay, J.A. Leo. &quot;Franklin, Benjamin (1706-1790),&quot; [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/52466 ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'']. ed. H.C.G. Matthew and Brian Harrison (Oxford: OUP, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deborah Read===
In 1724, while a boarder in the Read home, Franklin had courted Deborah Read before going to London at Governor Keith's request. At that time, Miss Read's mother was wary of allowing her daughter to wed a seventeen-year old who was on his way to London. Her own husband having recently died, Mrs. Read declined Franklin's offer of marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;

While Franklin was in London, Deborah married a man named John Rodgers. This proved to be a regrettable decision. Rodgers shortly avoided his debts and prosecution by fleeing to [[Barbados]], leaving Deborah behind. With Rodgers' fate unknown, and bigamy illegal, Deborah was not free to remarry.

In 1730, Franklin acknowledged an illegitimate son named [[William Franklin|William]], who would eventually become the last Loyalist governor of [[New Jersey]]. While the identity of William's mother remains unknown, perhaps the responsibility of an infant child gave Franklin a reason to take up residence with Deborah Read. William was raised in the Franklin household but eventually broke with his father over the treatment of the colonies at the hands of the crown. However, he was not above using his father's fame to enhance his own standing.

Franklin established a [[common-law marriage]] with Deborah Read on September 1, 1730{{Fact|date=July 2008}}. In addition to raising William, Benjamin and Deborah Franklin had two children together. The first, Francis Folger Franklin, born October 1732, died of [[smallpox]] in 1736. [[Sarah Franklin Bache|Sarah Franklin]], nicknamed Sally, was born in 1743. She eventually married [[Richard Bache]], had seven children, and cared for her father in his old age.

Deborah's fear of the sea meant that she never accompanied Franklin on any of his extended trips to Europe, despite his repeated requests. However, Franklin did not leave London to visit Deborah even after she wrote to him in November 1769 saying her illness was due to “dissatisfied distress” because of his prolonged absence.&lt;ref&gt; November 1769 [http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=16&amp;page=230a Letter] from Deborah Read to Ben Franklin, ''franklinpapers.org'' &lt;/ref&gt;  Deborah Read Franklin died of a [[stroke]] in 1774, while Benjamin was on an extended trip to England.

===Success as an author===
In 1733, Franklin began to publish the famous ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' (with content both original and borrowed) under the [[pseudonym]] Richard Saunders, on which much of his popular reputation is based. Franklin frequently wrote under pseudonyms. Although it was no secret that Franklin was the author, his Richard Saunders character repeatedly denied it.  &quot;Poor Richard's Proverbs,&quot; adages from this almanac, such as &quot;A penny saved is twopence dear&quot; (often misquoted as &quot;A penny saved is a penny earned&quot;), &quot;Fish and visitors stink in three days&quot; remain common quotations in the modern world. Wisdom in folk society meant the ability to provide an apt adage for any occasion, and Franklin's readers became well prepared. He sold about ten thousand copies per year (a circulation equivalent to nearly three million today).&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;

In 1758, the year in which he ceased writing for the Almanack, he printed ''Father Abraham's Sermon'', also known as [[The Way to Wealth]]. Franklin's [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]], published after his death, has become one of the classics of the genre.

===Inventions and scientific inquiries===
[[Image:Glassharmonica.png|thumb|180px|An armonica.]]

Franklin was a prodigious inventor. Among his many creations were the [[lightning rod]], the [[glass harmonica]], the [[Franklin stove]], [[bifocals|bifocal glasses]], and the flexible [[urinary catheterization|urinary catheter]]. Franklin never patented his inventions; in his [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]] he wrote, &quot;... as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|chapter=Part three|author=Benjamin Franklin|url=http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page55.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; His inventions also included [[social innovation]]s, such as [[Pay it forward|paying forward]].

As deputy postmaster, Franklin became interested in the North Atlantic Ocean circulation patterns which carried mail ships. Franklin worked with Timothy Folger, his cousin and experienced Nantucket whaler captain, and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the [[Gulf Stream]], giving it the name by which it's still known today. It took many years for British sea captains to follow Franklin's advice on navigating the current, but once they did, they were able to gain two weeks in sailing time.&lt;ref&gt;1785: Benjamin Franklin's 'Sundry Maritime Observations', The Academy of Natural Sciences, April, 1939m&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/library/readings/gulf/gulf.html ''1785: Benjamin Franklin's 'Sundry Maritime Observations' ''.] NOAA Ocean Explorer.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1743, Franklin founded the [[American Philosophical Society]] to help scientific men discuss their discoveries and theories. He began the electrical research that, along with other scientific inquiries, would occupy him for the rest of his life, in between bouts of politics and moneymaking.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:BenFranklin Waterspout 1806.jpg|thumb|180px|right|An illustration from Franklin's paper on &quot;[[waterspout|Water-spouts]] and Whirlwinds.&quot;]]

In 1748, he retired from printing and went into other businesses. He created a partnership with his foreman, David Hall, which provided Franklin with half of the shop's profits for 18 years. This lucrative business arrangement provided leisure time for study, and in a few years he had made discoveries that gave him a reputation with the educated throughout Europe and especially in France.

His discoveries included his investigations of electricity. Franklin proposed that &quot;vitreous&quot; and &quot;resinous&quot; electricity were not different types of &quot;[[Aether theories|electrical fluid]]&quot; (as electricity was called then), but the same electrical fluid under different pressures. He was the first to label them as [[electric charge|positive and negative]] respectively,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/FranklinBenjamin.html ''Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790).''] Science World, from Eric Weisstein's World of Scientific Biography.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was the first to discover the principle of [[charge conservation|conservation of charge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physchem.co.za/Static%20Electricity/Charge.htm ''Conservation of Charge''.] &lt;/ref&gt; In 1750, he published a proposal for an experiment to prove that lightning is electricity by flying a [[kite]] in a [[storm]] that appeared capable of becoming a [[lightning]] storm. On May 10, 1752, [[Thomas-François Dalibard]] of France conducted Franklin's experiment (using a {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}}-tall iron rod instead of a kite) and extracted electrical sparks from a cloud. On June 15, Franklin may have possibly conducted his famous kite experiment [[St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, Philadelphia#Franklin|in Philadelphia]] and also successfully extracted sparks from a cloud, although there are theories that suggest he never performed the experiment. Franklin's experiment was not written up until [[Joseph Priestley]]'s 1767 ''History and Present Status of Electricity''; the evidence shows that Franklin was insulated (not in a conducting path, since he would have been in danger of [[electric shock|electrocution]] in the event of a lightning strike). (Others, such as Prof. [[Georg Wilhelm Richmann]] of [[Saint Petersburg|Saint Petersburg, Russia]], were electrocuted during the months following Franklin's experiment.) In his writings, Franklin indicates that he was aware of the dangers and offered alternative ways to demonstrate that lightning was electrical, as shown by his use of the concept of [[ground (electricity)|electrical ground]]. If Franklin did perform this experiment, he did not do it in the way that is often described, flying the kite and waiting to be struck by lightning, as it would have been fatal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mos.org/sln/toe/kite.html ''Franklin's Kite''.] Museum of Science, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he used the kite to collect some electric charge from a storm cloud, which implied that lightning was electrical.

On October 19 in a letter to England explaining directions for repeating the experiment, Franklin wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;When rain has wet the kite twine so that it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it streams out plentifully from the key at the approach of your knuckle, and with this key a phial, or Leiden jar, maybe charged: and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled, and all other electric experiments [may be] performed which are usually done by the help of a rubber glass globe or tube; and therefore the sameness of the electrical matter with that of lightening completely demonstrated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, A., ''History of Science, Technology, and Philosophy in the Eighteenth Century''. New York, 1939. p.232&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franklin's electrical experiments led to his invention of the lightning rod. He noted that conductors with a sharp rather than a smooth point were capable of discharging silently, and at a far greater distance. He surmised that this knowledge could be of use in protecting buildings from lightning, by attaching &quot;upright Rods of Iron, made sharp as a Needle and gilt to prevent Rusting, and from the Foot of those Rods a Wire down the outside of the Building into the Ground;...Would not these pointed Rods probably draw the Electrical Fire silently out of a Cloud before it came nigh enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible Mischief!&quot; Following a series of experiments on Franklin's own house, lightning rods were installed on the Academy of Philadelphia (later the University of Pennsylvania) and the Pennsylvania State House (later Independence Hall) in 1752.&lt;ref&gt;Krider, E. Philip. [http://www.physicstoday.org/vol-59/iss-1/p42.html ''Benjamin Franklin and Lightning Rods''.] Physics Today. January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of his work with electricity, Franklin received the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Copley Medal]] in 1753, and in 1756 he became one of the few eighteenth century Americans to be elected as a Fellow of the Society. The [[centimetre gram second system of units|cgs]] unit of electric charge has been named after him: one ''franklin'' (Fr) is equal to one [[statcoulomb]].

On October 21, 1743, according to popular myth, a storm moving from the southwest denied Franklin the opportunity of witnessing a [[lunar eclipse]]. Franklin was said to have noted that the [[prevailing winds]] were actually from the northeast, contrary to what he had expected. In correspondence with his brother, Franklin learned that the same storm had not reached Boston until after the eclipse, despite the fact that Boston is to the northeast of Philadelphia. He deduced that storms do not always travel in the direction of the prevailing wind, a concept which would have great influence in [[meteorology]].&lt;ref&gt;Heidorn, Keith C. Heidorn, PhD. [http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/almanac/arc2003/alm03oct.htm ''Eclipsed By Storm''.] The Weather Doctor. October 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin noted a principle of [[refrigeration]] by observing that on a very hot day, he stayed cooler in a wet shirt in a breeze than he did in a dry one. To understand this phenomenon more clearly Franklin conducted experiments. On one warm day in [[Cambridge]], England, in 1758, Franklin and fellow scientist John Hadley experimented by continually wetting the ball of a mercury [[thermometer]] with [[diethyl ether|ether]] and using [[bellows]] to evaporate the ether. With each subsequent [[evaporation]], the thermometer read a lower temperature, eventually reaching 7°F (-14°C). Another thermometer showed the room [[temperature]] to be constant at 65°F (18°C). In his letter &quot;[[evaporative cooling|Cooling by Evaporation]],&quot; Franklin noted that &quot;one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer’s day.&quot;

===Musical endeavors===
Franklin is known to have played the [[violin]], the [[harp]], and the [[guitar]]. He also composed music, notably a [[string quartet]] in [[classical period (music)|early classical style]], and invented a much-improved version of the [[glass harmonica]], in which each glass was made to rotate on its own, with the player's fingers held steady, instead of the other way around; this version soon found its way to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Thomas. [http://www.finkenbeiner.com/gh.html ''The Glassharmonica''.] GFI Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public life===
In 1736, Franklin created the [[Union Fire Company]], one of the first volunteer [[fire fighting]] companies in America. In the same year, he printed a new currency for [[New Jersey]] based on innovative anti-[[counterfeit]]ing techniques which he had devised.

As he matured, Franklin began to concern himself more with public affairs. In 1743, he set forth a scheme for [[The Academy and College of Philadelphia]]. He was appointed president of the academy in November 13, 1749, and it opened on August 13, 1751. At its first commencement, on May 17, 1757, seven men graduated; six with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and one as [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]]. It was later merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to become the University of Pennsylvania.

In 1753, both [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] awarded him honorary degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gophila.com/Go/PressRoom/pressreleases/ben300/Resume_Ben_Franklin_Fact_Sheet.aspx ''Benjamin Franklin resume''.] Official Visitor Site for Greater Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1751, Franklin and [[Thomas Bond (physician)|Dr. Thomas Bond]] obtained a charter from the Pennsylvania legislature to establish a hospital. [[Pennsylvania Hospital]] was the first hospital in what was to become the United States of America.

[[Image:joinordie.jpg|right|thumb|[[Join, or Die]]: This political cartoon by Franklin urged the colonies to join together during the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]).]]

Franklin became involved in Philadelphia politics and rapidly progressed. In October 1748, he was selected as a councilman, in June 1749 he became a [[Justice of the Peace]] for Philadelphia, and in 1751 he was elected to the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly|Pennsylvania Assembly]]. On August 10, 1753, Franklin was appointed joint deputy postmaster-general of North America. His most notable service in domestic politics was his reform of the postal system, but his fame as a statesman rests chiefly on his subsequent diplomatic services in connection with the relations of the colonies with Great Britain, and later with France.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;

In 1754, he headed the Pennsylvania delegation to the Albany Congress. This meeting of several colonies had been requested by the [[Board of Trade]] in England to improve relations with the Indians and defense against the French. Franklin proposed a broad Plan of Union for the colonies. While the plan was not adopted, elements of it found their way into the [[Articles of Confederation]] and the Constitution.

In 1756, Franklin organized the Pennsylvania Militia (see &quot;Associated Regiment of Philadelphia&quot; under heading of Pennsylvania's 103rd Artillery and 111th Infantry Regiment at [[Continental Army]]). He used [[Tun Tavern]] as a gathering place to recruit a regiment of soldiers to go into battle against the Native American uprisings that beset the American colonies. {Reportably Franklin was elected &quot;Colonel&quot; of the Associated Regiment but declined the honor}.

In 1757, he was sent to England by the Pennsylvania Assembly as a colonial agent to protest against the political influence of the Penn family, the proprietors of the colony. He remained there for five years, striving to end the proprietors' prerogative to overturn legislation from the elected Assembly, and their exemption from paying taxes on their land. His lack of influential allies in [[Whitehall]] led to the failure of this mission. In 1759, the [[University of St Andrews]] awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree. In 1762, [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] awarded Franklin an honorary doctorate for his scientific accomplishments and from then on he went by &quot;Doctor Franklin.&quot; He also managed to secure a post for his illegitimate son, William Franklin, as [[Governor of New Jersey|Colonial Governor of New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;

During his stay in London, Franklin became involved in radical politics. He was a member of the [[Club of Honest Whigs]], alongside thinkers such as [[Richard Price]].

In 1756, Franklin became a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce (now [[Royal Society of Arts]] or RSA, which had been founded in 1754), whose early meetings took place in coffee shops in London's [[Covent Garden]] district, close to Franklin's main residence in Craven Street (the only one of his residences to survive and which opened to the public as the [[Benjamin Franklin House]] museum on January 17, 2006). After his return to America, Franklin became the Society's Corresponding Member and remained closely connected with the Society. The RSA instituted a Benjamin Franklin Medal in 1956 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Franklin's birth and the 200th anniversary of his membership of the RSA.

During his stays at Craven Street in London between 1757 and 1775, Franklin developed a close friendship with his landlady, Margaret Stevenson and her circle of friends and relations, in particular her daughter Mary, who was more often known as Polly.

In 1759, he visited [[Edinburgh]] with his son, and recalled his conversations there as &quot;the ''densest'' happiness of my life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Buchan, James. ''Crowded with Genius: The Scottish Enlightenment: Edinburgh's Moment of the Mind''. HarperCollins Publishers. 2003. p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

He also joined the influential [[Birmingham]] based [[Lunar Society]] with whom he regularly corresponded and on occasion, visited in Birmingham in the West Midlands.

[[Image:Benjamin Franklin by Benjamin Wilson, 1759.jpg|thumb|Benjamin Franklin by [[Benjamin Wilson (painter)|Benjamin Wilson]], 1759.]]

===Coming of Revolution===
In 1763, soon after Franklin returned to Pennsylvania, the western frontier was engulfed in a bitter war known as [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]. The [[Paxton Boys]], a group of settlers convinced that the Pennsylvania government was not doing enough to protect them from [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] raids, murdered a group of peaceful [[Susquehannock]] Indians and then marched on Philadelphia. Franklin helped to organize the local militia in order to defend the capital against the mob, and then met with the Paxton leaders and persuaded them to disperse. Franklin wrote a scathing attack against the racial prejudice of the Paxton Boys. &quot;If an ''Indian'' injures me,&quot; he asked, &quot;does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all ''Indians''?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin. [http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/massacre.htm &quot;A Narrative of the Late Massacres...&quot;] reprinted on The History Carper.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, many members of the Pennsylvania Assembly were feuding with [[List_of_colonial_governors_of_Pennsylvania#Proprietors|William Penn's heirs]], who controlled the colony as [[proprietary colony|proprietors]]. Franklin led the &quot;anti-proprietary party&quot; in the struggle against the Penn family, and was elected [[Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives|Speaker of the Pennsylvania House]] in May 1764. His call for a change from proprietary to royal government was a rare political miscalculation, however: Pennsylvanians worried that such a move would endanger their political and religious freedoms. Because of these fears, and because of political attacks on his character, Franklin lost his seat in the October 1764 Assembly elections. The anti-proprietary party dispatched Franklin to England to continue the struggle against the Penn family proprietorship, but during this visit, events would drastically change the nature of his mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANB&quot;&gt;J. A. Leo Lemay, &quot;Franklin, Benjamin&quot;. ''[[American National Biography Online]]'', February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In London, Franklin opposed the [[Stamp Act 1765|1765 Stamp Act]], but when he was unable to prevent its passage, he made another political miscalculation and recommended a friend to the post of stamp distributor for Pennsylvania. Pennsylvanians were outraged, believing that he had supported the measure all along, and threatened to destroy his home in Philadelphia. Franklin soon learned of the extent of colonial resistance to the Stamp Act, and his testimony before the House of Commons led to its repeal. With this, Franklin suddenly emerged as the leading spokesman for American interests in England. He wrote popular essays on behalf of the colonies, and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Massachusetts]] also appointed him as their agent to the Crown.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANB&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Franklin-Benjamin-LOC.jpg|thumb|left|Franklin in 1783, an engraving from a painting by [[Joseph Duplessis]].]]

In September 1767, Franklin visited Paris with his usual traveling partner, Sir [[John Pringle]]. News of his electrical discoveries was widespread in France. His reputation meant that he was introduced to many influential scientists and politicians, and also to [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isaacson&quot;&gt;Isaacson, Walter. ''Benjamin Franklin: An American Life''. Simon &amp; Schuster. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in London in 1768, he developed a [[Benjamin Franklin's phonetic alphabet|phonetic alphabet]] in ''A Scheme for a new Alphabet and a Reformed Mode of Spelling''. This reformed alphabet discarded six letters Franklin regarded as redundant (c, j, q, w, x and y), and substituted six new letters for sounds he felt lacked letters of their own. His new alphabet, however, never caught on and he eventually lost interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/franklin.htm ''Benjamin Franklin's Phonetic Alphabet''.] Omniglot.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1771, Franklin traveled extensively around the British Isles staying with, among others, [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[David Hume]]. In [[Dublin]], Franklin was invited to sit with the members of the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] rather than in the gallery. He was the first American to be given this honor.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Jared. [http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/biography/chap05.htm ''Life of Benjamin Franklin''.] US History.org.&lt;/ref&gt; While touring Ireland, he was moved by the level of poverty he saw. Ireland's economy was affected by the same trade regulations and laws of England which governed America. Franklin feared that America could suffer the same effects should Britain’s colonial exploitation continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/exp_worldly_ireland.html ''Benjamin Franklin''.] PBS.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1773, Franklin published two of his most celebrated pro-American satirical essays: [[s:Rules By Which A Great Empire May Be Reduced To A Small One|''Rules by Which a Great Empire May Be Reduced to a Small One'']], and ''An Edict by the King of Prussia''.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin. [http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/pa-1773.htm reprinted on The History Carper.]&lt;/ref&gt; He also published an ''Abridgment of the Book of Common Prayer'', anonymously with [[Francis Dashwood, 15th Baron le Despencer|Francis Dashwood]]. Among the unusual features of this work is a funeral service reduced to six minutes in length, &quot;to preserve the health and lives of the living.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;isaacson&quot;/&gt;

===Hutchinson Letters===
Franklin obtained private letters of Massachusetts governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] and lieutenant governor [[Andrew Oliver]] which proved they were encouraging London to crack down on the rights of the Bostonians. Franklin sent them to America where they escalated the tensions. Franklin now appeared to the British as the fomenter of serious trouble. Hopes for a peaceful solution ended as he was systematically ridiculed and humiliated by the Privy Council. He left London in March 1775.&lt;ref name=&quot;isaacson&quot;/&gt;

===Declaration of Independence===
[[Image:Declaration independence.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[John Trumbull]] depicts the [[Committee of Five]] presenting their work to the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrevolution.org/deckey.html Key to Declaration] American Revolution.org.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

By the time Franklin arrived in Philadelphia on May 5, the [[American Revolution]] had begun with fighting at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]]. The New England [[militia]] had trapped the main British army in Boston. The Pennsylvania Assembly unanimously chose Franklin as their delegate to the [[Second Continental Congress]]. In June 1776, he was appointed a member of the [[Committee of Five]] that drafted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Although he was temporarily disabled by [[gout]] and unable to attend most meetings of the Committee, Franklin made several small changes to the draft sent to him by [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isaacson&quot;/&gt;

At the signing, he is quoted as having replied to a comment by Hancock that they must all hang together: &quot;Yes, we must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Ambassador to France: 1776-1785===
In December 1776, Franklin was dispatched to France as [[commissioner]] for the United States. He lived in a home in the Parisian suburb of [[Passy]], donated by [[Jacques-Donatien Le Ray|Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont]] who supported the United States. Franklin remained in France until 1785, and was such a favorite of French society that it became fashionable for wealthy French families to decorate their parlors with a painting of him. He was highly flirtatious in the French manner (but did not have any actual affairs{{Fact|date=July 2008}}). He conducted the affairs of his country towards the French nation with great success, which included securing a critical military alliance in 1778 and negotiating the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]]. During his stay in France, Benjamin Franklin as a freemason was Grand Master of the Lodge [[Les Neuf Sœurs]] from 1779 until 1781. His number was 24 in the Lodge. He was also a Past Grand Master of Pennsylvania. In 1784, when [[Franz Mesmer]] began to publicize his theory of &quot;animal magnetism&quot;, which was considered offensive by many, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] appointed a commission to investigate it. These included the chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]], the physician [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]], the astronomer [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]] and Benjamin Franklin.

===Constitutional Convention===
When he finally returned home in 1785, Franklin occupied a position only second to that of [[George Washington]] as the champion of American independence. Le Ray honored him with a commissioned portrait painted by [[Joseph Duplessis]] that now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] After his return, Franklin became an abolitionist, freeing both of his slaves. He eventually became president of the [[Pennsylvania Abolition Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/l3_citizen_abolitionist.html ''Citizen Ben, Abolitionist''.] PBS.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1787, Franklin served as a delegate to the [[Philadelphia Convention]]. He held an honorific position and seldom engaged in debate. He is the only Founding Father who is a signatory of all four of the major documents of the founding of the United States: the Declaration of Independence, the Treaty of Paris, the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] with France, and the United States Constitution.

In 1787, a group of prominent ministers in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], proposed the foundation of a new college to be named in Franklin's honor. Franklin donated £200 towards the development of Franklin College, which is now called Franklin &amp; Marshall College.

Between 1771 and 1788, he finished his [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]]. While it was at first addressed to his son, it was later completed for the benefit of mankind at the request of a friend.

In his later years, as Congress was forced to deal with the issue of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]], Franklin wrote several essays that attempted to convince his readers of the importance of the abolition of slavery and of the integration of Africans into American society. These writings included:
*''[[s:An Address to the Public|An Address to the Public]]'', (1789)
*''[[s:A Plan for Improving the Condition of the Free Blacks|A Plan for Improving the Condition of the Free Blacks]]'' (1789), and
*''Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim on the Slave Trade'' (1790).

In 1790, Quakers from New York and Pennsylvania presented their petition for abolition. Their argument against slavery was backed by the Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society and its president, Benjamin Franklin.

===President of Pennsylvania===
Special balloting conducted October 18, 1785 unanimously elected Franklin the sixth [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Presidents of Council|President]] of the [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania]], replacing John Dickinson. The office of President of Pennsylvania was analogous to the modern position of [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|Governor]]. It is not clear why Dickinson needed to be replaced with less than two weeks remaining before the regular election. Franklin held that office for slightly over three years, longer than any other, and served the Constitutional limit of three full terms. Shortly after his initial election he was re-elected to a full term on October 29, 1785, and again in the fall of 1786 and on October 31, 1787. Officially, his term concluded on November 5, 1788, but there is some question regarding the ''[[de facto]]'' end of his term, suggesting that the aging Franklin may not have been actively involved in the day-to-day operation of the Council toward the end of his time in office.

===Virtue, religion and personal beliefs===
[[Image:Franklin bust - jean-antoine houdon.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A bust of Franklin by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]].]]

Like the other advocates of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], Franklin emphasized that the new republic could survive only if the people were virtuous in the sense of attention to civic duty and rejection of corruption. All his life he had been exploring the role of civic and personal virtue, as expressed in ''Poor Richard's'' aphorisms.

Franklin had been baptized and educated in a Presbyterian Church based on the doctrines of John Calvin.  Deborah Franklin, his wife, retained a life long association with Christ Church, Philadelphia.  Franklin later in life rarely attended Sunday services but commented that &quot;...Sunday being my studying day, I never was without some religious principles. I never doubted, for instance, the existence of the Deity; that He made the world, and governed it by His providence; that the most acceptable service of God was the doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crime will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Franklin Benjamin[http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/singlehtml.htm &quot;Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography&quot;.] Section 2 reprinted on UShistory.org. &lt;/ref&gt;

One of Franklin's endearing beliefs was in the respect and tolerance of all religious groups.  Referring to his experience in Philadelphia, he wrote in his [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]], &quot;new Places of worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary Contribution, my Mite for such purpose, whatever might be the Sect, was never refused.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

Although Franklin's parents had intended for him to have a career in the church, Franklin became disillusioned with organized religion after discovering [[Deism]]. &quot;I soon became a thorough Deist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin. [http://www.usgennet.org/usa/topic/preservation/bios/franklin/chpt4.htm ''Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography''.] Chapter IV. reprinted on USGenNet.org.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to attack Christian principles of free will and morality in a 1725 pamphlet, ''[[A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain]].''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf1/m7.htm A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain]&lt;/ref&gt; He consistently attacked religious dogma, arguing that morality was more dependent upon virtue and benevolent actions than on strict obedience to religious orthodoxy: &quot;I think opinions should be judged by their influences and effects; and if a man holds none that tend to make him less virtuous or more vicious, it may be concluded that he holds none that are dangerous, which I hope is the case with me.&quot;

In 1790, just about a month before he died, Franklin wrote the following in a letter to [[Ezra Stiles]], president of Yale, who had asked him his views on religion:

{{cquote2|As to [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]], my Opinion of whom you particularly desire, I think the System of Morals and his Religion, as he left them to us, the best the world ever saw or is likely to see; but I apprehend it has received various corrupt changes, and I have, with most of the present Dissenters in England, some Doubts as to his divinity; tho' it is a question I do not dogmatize upon, having never studied it, and I think it needless to busy myself with it now, when I expect soon an Opportunity of knowing the Truth with less Trouble....&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;}}

Like most [[American Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] intellectuals, Franklin separated virtue, morality, and faith from organized religion, although he felt that if religion in general grew weaker, morality, virtue, and society in general would also decline. Thus he wrote [[Thomas Paine]], &quot;If men are so wicked with religion, what would they be if without it.&quot;  According to David Morgan,&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, David T. ''Benjamin Franklin: Champion of Generic Religion.'' The Historian. 62#4 2000. pp 722+&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin was a proponent of all religions. He prayed to ''&quot;Powerful Goodness&quot;'' and referred to God as the ''&quot;INFINITE.&quot;'' [[John Adams]] noted that Franklin was a mirror in which people saw their own religion: &quot;The [[Catholicism|Catholics]] thought him almost a Catholic. The [[Church of England]] claimed him as one of them. The Presbyterians thought him half a Presbyterian, and the Friends believed him a wet Quaker.&quot; Whatever else Benjamin Franklin was, concludes Morgan, &quot;he was a true champion of generic religion.&quot; Ben Franklin was noted to be &quot;the spirit of the Enlightenment.&quot;

[[Walter Isaacson]] argues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/129/story_12914.html |title=Franklin Defines His God |author=[[Walter Isaacson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Franklin became uncomfortable with an unenhanced version of Deism and came up with his own conception of the Creator. Franklin outlined his concept of deity in 1728, in his ''Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf2/articles.htm reprinted at The History Carper.]&lt;/ref&gt; From this, Isaacson compares Franklin's conception of deity to that of strict Deists and orthodox Christians. He concludes that unlike most pure Deists, Franklin believed that a faith in God should inform our daily actions,&lt;!---Isaacson is quite misleading here - Essential Deism includes: 1. Virtue and piety are the chief parts of divine worship. 2. We ought to be sorry for our sins and repent of them. 3. Divine goodness doth dispense rewards and punishments both in this life and after it. REF is at [[Deism#Early_deism]] AND at http://books.google.com/books?id=WFUkwHl0fFkC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=&quot;rewards&quot;#PPA4,M1 --&gt; but that, like other Deists, his faith was devoid of sectarian dogma. Isaacson also discusses Franklin's conception that God had created beings who do interfere in wordly matters, a point that has led some commentators, most notably A. Owen Aldridge, to read Franklin as embracing some sort of polytheism, with a bevy of lesser gods overseeing various realms and planets.

On July 4, 1776, Congress appointed a committee that included Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams to design the [[Great Seal of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Skousen, W. Cleon. ''The Five Thousand Year Leap''. National Center for Constitutional Studies (1981), pp. 17-18. summarizes how this committee created and approved the first proposed design for the seal (which ultimately was not adopted).&lt;/ref&gt; Each member of the committee proposed a unique design: Franklin's proposal featured a design with the motto: &quot;Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God.&quot; This design was to portray a scene from the Book of [[Exodus]], complete with [[Moses]], the [[Israel]]ites, the pillar of fire, and George III depicted as [[Pharaoh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatseal.com/committees/firstcomm/index.html ''First Great Seal Committee – July/August 1776''.] Great Seal.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin may have financially supported one particular Presbyterian group in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/hst/biography/TheAutobiographyofBenjaminFranklin/chap28.html World Wide School.com.] [[World Wide School]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the epitaph Franklin wrote for himself at the age of twenty, it is clear that he believed in a physical resurrection of the body some time after death. Franklin's actual grave, however, as he specified in his final will, simply reads &quot;Benjamin and Deborah Franklin.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;zmerdn&quot;&gt;[http://sln.fi.edu/franklin/family/lastwill.html ''The Last Will and Testament of Benjamin Franklin''.] The Franklin Institute Science Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtue===
Franklin sought to cultivate his character by a plan of thirteen virtues, which he developed at age 20 (in 1726) and continued to practice in some form for the rest of his life. His [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]] lists his thirteen virtues as:

# &quot;TEMPERANCE. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.&quot;
# &quot;SILENCE. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.&quot;
# &quot;ORDER. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.&quot;
# &quot;RESOLUTION. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.&quot;
# &quot;FRUGALITY. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.&quot;
# &quot;INDUSTRY. Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.&quot;
# &quot;SINCERITY. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.&quot;
# &quot;JUSTICE. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.&quot;
# &quot;MODERATION. Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.&quot;
# &quot;CLEANLINESS. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation.&quot;
# &quot;TRANQUILLITY. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.&quot;
# &quot;CHASTITY. Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.&quot;
# &quot;HUMILITY. Imitate Jesus and [[Socrates]].&quot;

Franklin didn't try to work on them all at once. Instead, he would work on one and only one each week &quot;leaving all others to their ordinary chance&quot;. While Franklin didn't live completely by his virtues and by his own admission, he fell short of them many times, he believed the attempt made him a better man contributing greatly to his success and happiness, which is why in his Autobiography, he devoted more pages to this plan than to any other single point; in his autobiography Franklin wrote, &quot;I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page38.htm ''Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin page 38 forward''] by Benjamin Franklin&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===
[[Image:BenjaminFranklinGrave.2005.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The grave of Benjamin Franklin, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.]]

Franklin died on April 17, 1790, at age 84. His funeral was attended by approximately 20,000 people. He was interred in [[Christ Church Burial Ground]] in Philadelphia. In 1728, aged 22, Franklin wrote what he hoped would be his own epitaph:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Body of B. Franklin Printer; Like the Cover of an old Book, Its Contents torn out, And stript of its Lettering and Gilding, Lies here, Food for Worms. But the Work shall not be wholly lost: For it will, as he believ'd, appear once more, In a new &amp; more perfect Edition, Corrected and Amended By the Author.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/franklin-epitaph.html ''Benjamin Franklin: In His Own Words''.] Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franklin's actual grave, however, as he specified in his final will, simply reads &quot;Benjamin and Deborah Franklin.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;zmerdn&quot;/&gt;

In 1773, when Franklin's work had moved from printing to science and politics, he corresponded with a French scientist on the subject of preserving the dead for later revival by more advanced scientific methods, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I should prefer to an ordinary death, being immersed with a few friends in a cask of Madeira, until that time, then to be recalled to life by the solar warmth of my dear country!  But in all probability, we live in a century too little advanced, and too near the infancy of science, to see such an art brought in our time to its perfection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.05/biotime.html?pg=1&amp;topic=biotime&amp;topic_set= The Doctor Will Freeze You Now] from [[Wired.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Extended excerpt also online.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_9.html Engines of Creation] E-drexler.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His death is described in the book ''The Life of Benjamin Franklin'', quoting from the account of Dr. John Jones:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...when the pain and difficulty of breathing entirely left him, and his family were flattering themselves with the hopes of his recovery, when an imposthume, which had formed itself in his lungs, suddenly burst, and discharged a quantity of matter, which he continued to throw up while he had power; but, as that failed, the organs of respiration became gradually oppressed; a calm, lethargic state succeeded; and on the 17th instant (April, 1790), about eleven o'clock at night, he quietly expired, closing a long and useful life of eighty-four years and three months.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, pp 529-530.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Benjamin Franklin National Memorial.jpg|left|thumb|Memorial marble statue of Benjamin Franklin]]

Franklin [[bequest|bequeathed]] £1,000 (about $4,400 at the time) each to the cities of Boston and Philadelphia, in trust to gather interest for 200 years. The trust began in 1785 when a French [[mathematician]] named Charles-Joseph Mathon de la Cour wrote a [[parody]] of Franklin's &quot;Poor Richard's Almanack&quot; called &quot;Fortunate Richard.&quot; Mocking the unbearable spirit of American optimism represented by Franklin, the Frenchman wrote that Fortunate Richard left a small sum of money in his will to be used only after it had collected interest for 500 years. Franklin, who was 79 years old at the time, wrote to the Frenchman, thanking him for a great idea and telling him that he had decided to leave a bequest of 1,000 pounds each to his native Boston and his adopted Philadelphia. As of 1990, more than $2,000,000 had accumulated in Franklin's Philadelphia trust, which had loaned the money to local residents. From 1940 to 1990, the money was used mostly for mortgage loans. When the trust came due, Philadelphia decided to spend it on scholarships for local high school students. Franklin's Boston trust fund accumulated almost $5,000,000 during that same time, and was used to establish a trade school that became the [[Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology|Franklin Institute of Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~sjg/class/1010/wc/finance/franklin1.html Excerpt from Philadelphia Inquirer article by Clark De Leon]&lt;/ref&gt;

A signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, Franklin is considered one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] of the U.S. His pervasive influence in the early history of the United States has led to his being called &quot;the only President of the United States who was never President of the United States.&quot;{{Fact|date=October 2008}} Franklin's likeness is ubiquitous. Since 1928, it has adorned American [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100 bills]], which are sometimes referred to in slang as &quot;Benjamins&quot; or &quot;Franklins.&quot; From 1948 to 1964, Franklin's portrait was on the [[Franklin half dollar|half dollar]]. He has appeared on a $50 bill and on several varieties of the $100 bill from 1914 and 1918. Franklin appears on the $1,000 Series EE [[Treasury security#Savings bond|Savings bond]]. The city of Philadelphia contains around 5,000 likenesses of Benjamin Franklin, about half of which are located on the University of Pennsylvania campus. Philadelphia's [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]] (a major thoroughfare) and [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]] (the first major bridge to connect Philadelphia with New Jersey) are named in his honor.

[[Image:BFHS Statue 2006.jpg|thumb|right|A marble statue of Benjamin Franklin stands in the atrium of [[Benjamin Franklin High School (New Orleans, Louisiana)|Benjamin Franklin High School]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]]]

In 1976, as part of a [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial]] celebration, [[United States Congress|Congress]] dedicated a 20-foot (6&amp;nbsp;m) marble statue in Philadelphia's Franklin Institute as the [[Benjamin Franklin National Memorial]]. Many of Franklin's personal possessions are also on display at the Institute, one of the few national memorials located on [[property|private property]].

In London, his house at 36 Craven Street was first marked with a [[blue plaque]] and has since been opened to the public as the Benjamin Franklin House.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/default.htm Benjamin Franklin House.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1998, workmen restoring the building dug up the remains of six children and four adults hidden below the home. ''[[The Times]]'' reported on February 11, 1998:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Initial estimates are that the bones are about 200 years old and were buried at the time Franklin was living in the house, which was his home from 1757 to 1762 and from 1764 to 1775. Most of the bones show signs of having been dissected, sawn or cut. One skull has been drilled with several holes. Paul Knapman, the Westminster Coroner, said yesterday: &quot;I cannot totally discount the possibility of a crime. There is still a possibility that I may have to hold an inquest.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Friends of Benjamin Franklin House (the organization responsible for the restoration) note that the bones were likely placed there by [[William Hewson (surgeon)|William Hewson]], who lived in the house for two years and who had built a small anatomy school at the back of the house. They note that while Franklin likely knew what Hewson was doing, he probably did not participate in any dissections because he was much more of a physicist than a medical man.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/news/pdf/Issue2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
&quot;The Princess and the Patriot: [[Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova|Ekaterina Dashkova]], Benjamin Franklin and the Age of Enlightenment&quot; exhibition opened in Philadelphia in February 2006 and ran through December 2006. Benjamin Franklin and Dashkova met only once, in Paris in 1781. Franklin was 75 and Dashkova was 37. Franklin invited Dashkova to become the first woman to join the American Philosophical Society and the only woman to be so honored for another 80 years. Later, Dashkova reciprocated by making him the first American member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

Considers the political consequences of the remarks in a 1751 pamphlet by Franklin on demographic growth and its implications for the colonies. He called the Pennsylvania Germans &quot;Palatine Boors&quot; who could never acquire the &quot;Complexion&quot; of the English settlers and to &quot;Blacks and Tawneys&quot; as weakening the social structure of the colonies. Although Franklin apparently reconsidered shortly thereafter, and the phrases were omitted from all later printings of the pamphlet, his views may have played a role in his political defeat in 1764.

'''William Edgar Oddie''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 7 July 1941) is an [[England|English]] [[actor]], [[writer]], [[comedian]], [[natural history]] [[presenter]] and [[musician]]. He became famous as one of the ''[[The Goodies]]''.

A [[birdwatching|birdwatcher]] since his childhood in [[Birmingham]], Oddie has now established a reputation for himself as an [[Ornithology|ornithologist]], [[conservationist]] and [[television presenter]] on [[wildlife]] issues. Some of his books are illustrated with his own paintings and drawings.

Oddie's wildlife programmes for the [[BBC]] include: ''[[Springwatch with Bill Oddie|Springwatch]]'' / ''Autumnwatch'', ''[[Bill Oddie's How to Watch Wildlife|How to Watch Wildlife]]'', ''[[Wild In Your Garden]]'', ''[[Birding with Bill Oddie]]'', ''[[Britain Goes Wild with Bill Oddie]]'' and ''[[Bill Oddie Goes Wild]]''.

== Career ==
===Comedy===
After attending Halesowen Grammar School (now The [[Earls High School]], [[Halesowen]]) then [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], Oddie studied [[English Literature]] at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he appeared in several [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] productions. One of these, a [[revue]] called ''A Clump of Plinths'', was so successful during its run at the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] that it was renamed ''[[Cambridge Circus (comedy)|Cambridge Circus]]'' and transferred to the [[West End theatre|West End]] in [[London]], then [[New Zealand]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in September 1964. Meanwhile, still at Cambridge, Oddie wrote scripts for TV's ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''. 

His first television appearance was in [[Bernard Braden]]'s ''On The Braden Beat'' in 1964. Subsequently, he was a key member of the performers in the cult [[BBC]] radio series ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' (ISIRTA; 1965), where many of his musical compositions were featured. Some were released on the album ''Distinctly Oddie'' (Polydor, 1967). He was possibly one of the first performers to [[parody]] a rock song, arranging the traditional [[Yorkshire]] folk song &quot;[[On Ilkla Moor Baht'at]]&quot; in the style of [[Joe Cocker]]'s hit rendition of [[the Beatles]]' &quot;''[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]''&quot; (released on [[John Peel]]'s [[Dandelion Records]] in 1970 and featured in Peel's special box of most-treasured singles), and singing &quot;''[[Andy Pandy]]''&quot; in the style of a brassy soul number such as [[Wilson Pickett]] or [[Geno Washington]] might perform. In many shows he would do short impressions of [[Hughie Green]].  

In one song on ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', Oddie performed &quot;''[[What a Wonderful World]]''&quot; with a voice fully reminiscent of [[Louis Armstrong]].  During the course of the song, the rest of the cast attributed the gravelly quality of his voice to a sore throat.  In the background, during the rest of the song, it is possible to hear the cast dispense cough medicine, then call for a doctor, the arrival of the doctor and his decision that Oddie should go into hospital, the trip to hospital in an ambulance, and the operation extracting his tonsils. After this, the sound of his voice changed to a sound closer to that of [[Harry Secombe]]. He thanked the cast for curing him.

On [[television]] Oddie was co-writer and performer in the comedy series ''[[Twice a Fortnight]]'' with [[Graeme Garden]], [[Terry Jones]], [[Michael Palin]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]].  Later, he was co-writer and performer in the comedy series ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] and [[Graeme Garden]], for which Oddie became a cast member for the second series.  

Oddie, Brooke-Taylor and Garden then co-wrote and appeared in their television comedy series ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]''. With long hair and a poster of [[Che Guevara]] in his corner, Bill portrayed the rebel, to Brooke-Taylor's patriotic conservative and Garden's boffin. The Goodies also released records, including &quot;Father Christmas Do Not Touch Me&quot;/&quot;The In-Betweenies&quot;, &quot;Funky Gibbon&quot;, and &quot;Black Pudding Bertha&quot;, which were hit singles in 1974/5. They reformed, briefly, in 2005, for a successful 13-date tour of [[Australia]].  Oddie, Brooke-Taylor and Garden also voiced characters on the 1983 animated children's programme ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Oddie voiced the characters of &quot;''Crow''&quot;, &quot;''Chief O'Reilly''&quot;, &quot;''Doctor Gloom''&quot;, &quot;''Eric''&quot; and &quot;''The Weatherman''&quot;.

In the Amnesty International show ''[[A Poke In The Eye (With A Sharp Stick)]]'', Oddie, Brooke-Taylor and Garden sang their hit song &quot;''Funky Gibbon''&quot;.  The trio also appeared on &quot;''[[Top of the Pops]]''&quot; with the song. Together with [[Graeme Garden|Garden]] (who is a qualified doctor), Oddie co-wrote many episodes of the television comedy series ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'', including most of the first season and all of the second season. He has occasionally appeared on the BBC Radio 4 panel game ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', on which Garden and Brooke-Taylor are regular panellists. In 1982 Garden and Oddie wrote, but did not perform in, a 6-part [[science fiction]] [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] called ''[[Astronauts (television)|Astronauts]]'' for [[Central Independent Television|Central]] and [[ITV]]. The show was set in an international [[space station]] in the near future

On its first evening of broadcast, ''Britain Goes Wild'' set a record for its timeslot of 8pm on [[BBC Two]] of 3.4 million viewers, one million more than the [[Channel 4]] programme showing at that time. It also created a run on [[nest box]]es for [[List of British birds: passerines|wild birds]] and [[bee|bumble bees]], [[bird bath]]s and bird feed from suppliers. ''Britain Goes Wild'', soon renamed ''Springwatch'', became a wildlife broadcasting phenomenon, with viewers at some times shooting up to 5 million.

===Music===
He played the [[Drum kit|drums]] and [[saxophone]] and appeared as Cousin Kevin in a production of [[The Who]]'s rock opera [[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]] at the [[Rainbow Theatre]], [[Finsbury Park]], [[London]] on 9 December 1972. He has also contributed vocals to a [[Rick Wakeman]] album, &quot;Criminal Record&quot;.        

Oddie took part in the [[English National Opera]] production of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[comic opera]] ''[[The Mikado]]'', in which he appeared in the role of the &quot;Lord High Executioner&quot;, taking over the role from [[Eric Idle]]. During the early 1990s, Oddie was a DJ for [[London]] based [[jazz]] radio station, [[102.2 Jazz FM]], but was dismissed after criticising the management on air after they told him he was playing too much jazz on his show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groove4dayz.com/peoplespeak/index.html PeopleSpeak&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially teacher [[Bridget Mermikides]] tries to teach him using traditional methods but he rebels: instead he turns to old friends [[Albert Lee]], Dave Davies (The Kinks) and [[Mark Knopfler]] for advice and strikes out on his own. He succeeds in the target of playing [[lead guitar]] for his daughter Rosie's band at her 21st birthday party, and even manages to impress his erstwhile teacher.

==Conservation and birdwatching==
Oddie's first published work was an article about the bird life of Birmingham's [[Bartley Reservoir]] in the [[West Midland Bird Club]]'s 1962 Annual Report.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/archive/bartley-62.htm Bartley Reservoir article from West Midland Bird Club's archive]&lt;/ref&gt; He has since written a number of books about birds and bird watching, as well as articles for many specialist publications including [[British Birds (Magazine)|''British Birds'']], ''Birdwatching Magazine'' and [[Birdwatch]]. He became president of the [[West Midland Bird Club]] in 1999, having been Vice-President since 1991, and is a former member of the council of the [[RSPB]]. Oddie is also a vice-president of the [[League Against Cruel Sports]].

In &quot;serious&quot; ornithological writing, Oddie's name is usually given formally, as &quot;W. E. Oddie&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Early life===
Oddie was born in Rochdale on 7 July 1941 to Lilian and Harry, who also had a daughter, Margaret Jean Oddie, but she died when 5 days old on 21 January 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;wdytya BO&quot;/&gt; Oddie lived at Oak Tree Crescent, [[Quinton, Birmingham]] from about age 6 to 15, brought up by his father, Harry, and his father's mother, Emily.&lt;ref name=&quot;wdytya BO&quot;/&gt; Oddie has no memory of his mother, Lilian, living at home.&lt;ref name=&quot;wdytya BO&quot;/&gt;  As a child she worked in a [[cotton mill]] under harsh conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;wdytya BO&quot;/&gt; She suffered from a chronic mental illness, perhaps [[manic depression]] or [[schizophrenia]], and abandoned Oddie at an early age.&lt;ref name=&quot;wdytya BO&quot;/&gt; She a was a long-term inpatient in [[Barnsley Hall Hospital]], Bromsgrove, for more than 20 years, having been first admitted as a voluntary patient at the age of 36 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;wdytya BO&quot;/&gt; When Harry was 17 years old his father, Wilkinson Oddie, died of heart failure on 23 February 1927, a post-operative death, after an operation for carcinoma of the left tonsil, which used [[chloroform]] as an anaesthetic.&lt;ref name=&quot;wdytya BO&quot;/&gt; Oddie developed a hobby in [[Birdwatching|bird spotting]], and his father encouraged school education.&lt;ref name=&quot;wdytya BO&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Who Do You Think You Are? with Bill Oddie |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/familyhistory/get_started/wdytya_s1_celeb_gallery_01.shtml

===Family===
Oddie is married to [[Laura Beaumont]], with whom he has worked on a variety of projects for children, including film scripts, drama and comedy series, puppet shows and books. They have a daughter, [[Rosie Oddie|Rosie]], and live in [[Hampstead]], [[London]].

Bill Oddie also has two daughters from his first marriage (to Jean Hart), Bonnie, and the actress [[Kate Hardie]], and a grandson, Lyle.

=== Depression ===
Oddie is known throughout the industry for his mood swings and often [[truculent]] behaviour, which contrasts sharply with his 'loveable' public image. He himself has often acknowledged that he has been a life-long sufferer of [[clinical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1885499,00.html 'I couldn't move. I was catatonic' | | guardian.co.uk Arts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honours===
In 2001, Oddie became the third person to turn down the &quot;red book&quot; and declined to appear on [[This Is Your Life]]. He changed his mind a few hours later though and agreed to appear on the show. On 16 October 2003, Oddie was made an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for his service to Wildlife Conservation in a ceremony at [[Buckingham Palace]]. He played down the event, choosing to wear a camouflage shirt and crumpled jacket to receive his medal. In June 2004, Oddie and [[Johnny Morris]] were jointly profiled in the first of a three part BBC Two series, ''[[The Way We Went Wild]]'', about television wildlife presenters. In May 2005, he received the [[British Naturalists' Association]]'s [[Peter Scott]] Memorial Award, from BNA president [[David Bellamy]], &quot;in recognition of his great contribution to our understanding of natural history and conservation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=144823 Bill Oddie to receive Peter Scott Memorial Award]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abraham Lincoln''' (February 12, 1809 &amp;ndash; April 15, 1865), the [[List of Presidents of the United States|sixteenth]] [[President of the United States]], successfully led his country through its greatest internal crisis, the [[American Civil War]], only to be [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassinated]] as the war was coming to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/apco/surrend.htm|title=General Robert E. Lee surrendered the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before becoming the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] elected to the Presidency, Lincoln was a [[lawyer]], an [[Illinois]] [[Illinois House of Representatives|state legislator]], a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], and an unsuccessful candidate for election to the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of [[slavery in the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|2005|p= 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holzer|2004|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln won the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination in 1860 and was [[United States presidential election, 1860|elected president]] later that year. During his time in office, he contributed to the effort to preserve the [[United States]] by leading the defeat of the [[Secession in the United States|secessionist]] [[Confederate States of America]] in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of [[slavery]], issuing his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in 1863 and promoting the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] to the Constitution, which passed Congress before Lincoln's death and was ratified by the states later in 1865.

Lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort, especially the selection of top [[Military rank|generals]], including [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the Republican Party well, bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. Lincoln successfully defused a [[Trent Affair|war scare]] with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland| United Kingdom]] in 1861. Under his leadership, the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] took control of the [[Border states (Civil War)|border slave states]] at the start of the war. Additionally, he managed his own reelection in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]].

Opponents of the war (also known as &quot;[[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]]&quot;) criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the [[Radical Republican (USA)|Radical Republicans]], an abolitionist faction of the Republican Party, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Even with these road blocks, Lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches; his [[Gettysburg Address]] is but one example of this. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|His assassination in 1865]] was the first presidential assassination in U.S. history and made him a [[martyr]] for the ideal of national unity.

==Early life==
{{Main|Abraham Lincoln's early life and career}}
===Childhood and education===
Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, to [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Hanks]], two uneducated farmers, in a one-room [[log cabin]] on the {{convert|348|acre|km2|1|sing=on}} Sinking Spring Farm, in southeast [[Hardin County, Kentucky]] (now part of [[LaRue County, Kentucky|LaRue County]]), making him the first president born outside the original [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Lincoln's ancestor [[Samuel Lincoln]] had arrived in [[Hingham, Massachusetts]] in the 17th century, but his descendants had gradually moved west, from Pennsylvania to Virginia and then westward to the frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Town of Hingham, Massachusetts|author=Tracy Bouvé, Thomas|year=1893|publisher=[[Harvard University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Abe-Lincoln-Birthplace-2.jpg|thumb|Symbolic log cabin at the [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site]]]]
For some time, Thomas Lincoln, Abraham's father, was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky backcountry. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt. The family belonged to a [[Hard-shell Baptists|Hardshell Baptist]] church, although Abraham himself never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.

In 1816, the Lincoln family was forced to make a new start in [[Perry County, Indiana|Perry County]] (now in [[Spencer County, Indiana|Spencer County]]), Indiana. He later noted that this move was &quot;partly on account of slavery,&quot; and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky: Unlike land in the [[Northwest Territory]], Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property.

When Lincoln was nine, his mother, then 34 years old, died of [[milk sickness]]. Soon afterwards, his father remarried to [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah Bush Johnston]]. Lincoln was affectionate toward his stepmother, whom he would call &quot;Mother&quot; for the rest of his life, but he was distant from his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1995|pp= 28, 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on public land&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/sites/decaturock.htm|title=Lincoln Trail Homestead State Park|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Macon County, Illinois]]. The following winter was desolate and especially brutal, and the family considered moving back to Indiana. The following year, when his father relocated the family to a [[Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site|new homestead]] in [[Coles County, Illinois]], 22-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the [[Sangamon River]] to the village of [[New Salem, Menard County, Illinois|New Salem]] in [[Sangamon County, Illinois|Sangamon County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fehrenbacher|first=Don|title=Speeches and Writings 1859-1865|publisher=Library of America|year=1989|pages=p.163|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UWJStTs8-A4C&amp;dq=lincoln+canoe+sangamon+river&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman [[Denton Offutt]] and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] via flatboat on the Sangamon, [[Illinois River|Illinois]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers.

Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling, but he was largely self-educated and an avid reader. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an axe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.lincolnportrait.com/physical_man.asp|title=Abraham Lincoln, The Physical Man |publisher=Lincoln Portrait}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sandburg|1974|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 6&amp;nbsp;foot 4&amp;nbsp;inches (1.93&amp;nbsp;m), he was unusually tall, as well as strong.

===Early political career and military service===
[[Image:Abe Lincoln young.jpg|thumb|left|Sketch of a younger Abraham Lincoln]]
Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 23, with an unsuccessful campaign for the [[Illinois General Assembly]], as a member of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the [[Beardstown and Sangamon Canal|Sangamon River]]. He believed that this would attract steamboat traffic, which would allow the sparsely populated, poorer areas along the river to flourish.

He was elected captain of an Illinois [[militia]] company drawn from New Salem during the [[Black Hawk War]], and later wrote that he had not had &quot;any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1952|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Basler|1946|p= 551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several months, Lincoln ran a small store in New Salem. In 1834, he won election to the state legislature, and, after coming across the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', began to teach himself law. [[Admission to the bar in the United States|Admitted to the bar]] in 1837, he moved to [[Springfield, Illinois]], that same year and began to practice law with [[John T. Stuart]]. With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frank|first=John|title=Lincoln as a Lawyer|publisher=Americana House|year=1991|isbn=0962529028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served four successive terms in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party. In 1837, he made his first protest against slavery in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was &quot;founded on both injustice and bad policy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=lincoln;cc=lincoln;type=simple;rgn=div1;q1=founded%20on%20both%20injustice%20and%20bad%20policy;view=text;subview=detail;sort=occur;idno=lincoln1;node=lincoln1%3A101|title=Protest in Illinois Legislature on Slavery|publisher=[[University of Michigan Library]]|date=1937-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also in this same year that Lincoln met [[Joshua Fry Speed]], who would become a close friend.

Lincoln wrote a series of anonymous letters, published in 1842 in the ''[[The State Journal-Register|Sangamon Journal]]'', mocking State Auditor and prominent Democrat [[James Shields]]. Two years later, Lincoln entered law practice with [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], a fellow Whig. In 1854, both men joined the fledgling [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. Following Lincoln's death, Herndon began collecting stories about Lincoln and published them in ''Herndon's Lincoln''.

[[Image:MTLincoln.jpg|thumb|The first photograph ever taken of [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Lincoln]], a [[daguerreotype]] by N.H. Shepherd, about 1846.]]

===Marriage and family===
On November 4, 1842 Lincoln married [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]], daughter of a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky. The couple had four sons. [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] was born in Springfield, Illinois on August 1, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young Robert attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and [[Harvard College]].

The other Lincoln children were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teen years. [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] was born on March 10, 1846, and died on February 1, 1850, also in Springfield. [[William Wallace Lincoln|William &quot;Willie&quot; Wallace Lincoln]] was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862 in [[Washington, D.C.]], during President Lincoln's first term. [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas &quot;Tad&quot; Lincoln]] was born on April 4, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871 in [[Chicago]].
[[Image:Abelincoln1846.jpeg|thumb|The first photograph ever taken of Abraham Lincoln, a daguerreotype by N.H. Shepherd, about 1846.]]

===Legislative activity===
A Whig and an admirer of party leader [[Henry Clay]], Lincoln was [[United States House elections, 1846|elected]] to a term in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1846. As a freshman House member, he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. However, he spoke out against the [[Mexican-American War]], which he attributed to [[James K. Polk|President Polk's]] desire for &quot;military glory&quot; and challenged the President's claims regarding the Texas boundary and offered [[Spot Resolutions]], demanding to know on what &quot;spot&quot; on US soil that blood was first spilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=020/llcg020.db&amp;recNum=102|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared, &quot;God of Heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women, and children, and lay waste and pillage the land of the just.&quot; Two weeks later, President Polk sent a peace treaty to Congress. While no one in Washington paid any attention to Lincoln, the Democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district, where the war was popular and many had volunteered.

Warned by his law partner, [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], that the damage was mounting and irreparable, Lincoln decided not to run for reelection. His statements were not easily forgotten, and would haunt him during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. These statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new Taylor administration. Instead, Taylor's people offered Lincoln various positions in the remote [[Oregon Territory]], primarily the [[List of Governors of Oregon|governorship]]. Acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of Illinois, so Lincoln declined the position. Returning to Springfield, Lincoln gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice.

===Prairie lawyer===
By the mid-1850s, Lincoln's caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of [[Barge|river barges]] and [[Rail transport|railroads]]. In one prominent 1851 case, he represented the [[Alton Railroad|Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad]] in a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer route proposed by Alton &amp; Sangamon was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly, the corporation had a right to sue Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the [[Supreme Court of Illinois|Illinois Supreme Court]] was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1995|loc=&amp;sect;6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil case which won Lincoln fame as a lawyer was the landmark [[Hurd v. Rock Island Bridge Company]]. America's expansion west, which Lincoln strongly supported, was seen as an economic threat to the river trade, which ran north-to-south, primarily on the [[Mississippi river]]. In 1856 a steamboat collided with a bridge, built by the [[Rock Island Railroad]], between [[Rock Island, Illinois]], and [[Davenport, Iowa]], the first railroad bridge to span the Mississippi. The steamboat owner sued for damages, claiming the bridge was a hazard to navigation. Lincoln argued in court for the railroad and won, removing a costly impediment to western expansion by establishing the right of land routes to bridge waterways.

This example is on the border of [[Piatt County, Illinois|Piatt]] and [[DeWitt County, Illinois|DeWitt counties]].]]

Possibly the most notable criminal trial of Lincoln's career as a lawyer came in 1858, when he defended [[William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong]], who had been charged with murder. The case became famous for Lincoln's use of [[judicial notice]] — a rare tactic at that time — to show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight, Lincoln produced a ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'' to show that the [[moon]] on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based almost entirely on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1995|pp=150–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln was involved in more than 5,100 cases in Illinois alone during his 23-year legal career. Though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ, others were more substantial and quite involved. Lincoln and his partners appeared before the Illinois State Supreme Court more than 400 times.

==Republican politics 1854&amp;ndash;1860==
Lincoln returned to politics in response to the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] (1854), which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's extent as determined by the [[Missouri Compromise]] (1820). Illinois Democrat [[Stephen A. Douglas]], the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed [[popular sovereignty]] as the solution to the slavery impasse, and incorporated it into the Kansas&amp;ndash;Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory, rather than have such a decision imposed on them by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1995|loc=&amp;sect;7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on remnants of the old Whig, Free Soil, Liberty and Democratic parties, he was instrumental in forming the new Republican Party. In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an ex-Democrat [[Lyman Trumbull]]. At the Republican convention in 1856, Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party's candidate for Vice-President.

In 1857-58, Douglas broke with President [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]], leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the [[Lecompton Constitution]], which would have admitted Kansas as a [[slave state]]. Accepting the Republican nomination for Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|his famous speech]]: &quot;'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.nationalcenter.org/HouseDivided.html|title=A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand|publisher=[[National Center for Public Policy Research]]|month=June |year=1858|author=Lincoln, Abraham}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the north.

===Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858===
{{main|Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858}}
The 1858 campaign featured the Lincoln-Douglas debates, a famous contest on slavery. Lincoln warned that &quot;[[The Slave Power]]&quot; was threatening the values of [[republicanism]], while Douglas emphasized the supremacy of [[democracy]], as set forth in his [[Freeport Doctrine]], which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more [[popular vote]]s, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's speeches on the issue transformed him into a national political star.
==1860 Presidential Election==

{{main|United States presidential election, 1860}}
Lincoln was chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals [[William H. Seward]] and [[Salmon P. Chase]]. His &quot;Western&quot; origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Why the Civil War Came|author=Boritt, Gabor S.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=[[1997-05-29]]|isbn=0195113764|pages=3–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|again, one person's opinion is presented as fact. Text seems to ignore the difference between prediction for the future &amp; hope for the future |date=June 2008}} On May 9-10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]]. At this convention, Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.

Throughout the general election, Lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. This was handled by the state and county Republican organizations, who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. There was little effort to convert non-Republicans, and there was virtually no campaigning in the South except for a few border cities such as [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling, Virginia]]; indeed, the party did not even run a slate in most of the South. In the North, there were thousands of Republican speakers, tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. These focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making the most of his boyhood poverty, his pioneer background, his native genius, and his rise from obscurity. His nicknames, &quot;Honest Abe&quot; and &quot;the Rail-Splitter,&quot; were exploited to the full. The goal was to emphasize the superior power of &quot;free labor,&quot; whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1952|p= 216}} See also: {{cite book|title=The First Lincoln Campaign|author=Luthin, Reinhard H.|publisher=Peter Smith Publishing|month=December |year=1987|isbn=0844612928}} and {{cite book|title=Ordeal of the Union Vol. 4|author=Nevins, Allan|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]]|date=[[1992-09-30]]|isbn=0020354452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, [[John C. Breckinridge]] of the Southern Democrats, and [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of the new [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]]. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other Southern states. Lincoln gained 1,865,908 votes (39.9% of the total), for 180 electoral votes; Douglas, 1,380,202 (29.5%) for 12 electoral votes; Breckenridge, 848,019 (18.1%) for 72 electoral votes; and Bell, 590,901 (12.5%) for 39 electoral votes. There were [[Electoral fusion|fusion tickets]] in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.

==Presidency and the Civil War==
{{main|Origins of the American Civil War}}
With the emergence of the Republicans as the nation's first major sectional party by the mid-1850s, politics became the stage on which sectional tensions were played out. Although much of the West{{ndash}} the focal point of sectional tensions{{ndash}} was unfit for cotton cultivation, Southern secessionists read the political fallout as a sign that their power in national politics was rapidly weakening. Before, the slave system had been buttressed to an extent by the Democratic Party, which was increasingly seen as representing a more pro-Southern position that unfairly permitted Southerners to prevail in the nation's territories and to dominate national policy before the Civil War. But they suffered a significant reverse in the electoral realignment of the mid-1850s. 1860 was a critical election that marked a stark change in existing patterns of party loyalties among groups of voters; Abraham Lincoln's election was a watershed in the balance of power of competing national and parochial interests and affiliations.

===Secession winter 1860&amp;ndash;1861===
{{main|Baltimore Plot|Cornerstone Speech}}
As Lincoln's election became more likely, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. On December 20, 1860, [[South Carolina]] took the lead. By February 1, 1861, South Carolina was followed by six other cotton-growing states in the deep South. The seven states soon declared themselves to be a new nation, the [[Confederate States of America]]. The upper South ([[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], [[Missouri]], and [[Arkansas]]) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.

Attempts at compromise, such as the [[Crittenden Compromise]] which would have extended the Missouri line of 1820, were discussed. Despite support for the Crittenden Compromise among some Republicans, Lincoln denounced it in private letters, saying &quot;either the Missouri line extended, or... Pop. Sov. would lose us everything we gained in the election; that filibustering for all South of us, and making slave states of it, would follow in spite of us, under either plan&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;

President-elect Lincoln [[Baltimore Plot|evaded possible assassins in Baltimore]], and on February 23, 1861, arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C.

[[Image:Abraham lincoln inauguration 1861.jpg|thumb|left|A photograph of the March 4, 1861 inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of [[United States Capitol]].]]
At his inauguration on March 4, 1861, the [[German American]] [[Turners]] formed Lincoln's bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion and local insurrection. In his [[Lincoln's First Inaugural|First Inaugural]] Address, Lincoln declared, &quot;I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments,&quot; arguing further that the purpose of the [[United States Constitution]] was &quot;to form a more perfect union&quot; than the [[Articles of Confederation]] which were ''explicitly'' perpetual, thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?

Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the pending [[Corwin Amendment]] to the Constitution, which had already passed Congress. This amendment, which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it already existed, had more appeal to the critical border states than to the states that had already declared their separation.

By the time Lincoln took office, the Confederacy was an established fact, and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. Buchanan might have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as [[Jeremiah S. Black]], [[Joseph Holt]], and [[Edwin M. Stanton]] had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession. Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March 1861: the Union could not be dismantled. Believing that a peaceful solution was still possible, Lincoln decided to not take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally happened in April 1861.

Historian [[Allan Nevins]] argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war. He &quot;temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis&quot;, overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and border states, and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The War for the Union Volume I.....The Improvised War 1861-1862|author=Nevins, Allan|publisher=Konecky &amp; Konecky|date=[[1971-09-01]]|isbn=1568522967|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In connection with Nevins's conclusions, it is interesting to note an incident from this period reported in the memoirs of [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]. Then a civilian, Sherman visited Lincoln in the White House during inauguration week, with his brother, Ohio Republican John Sherman. This meeting left the future General Sherman &quot;sadly disappointed&quot; at Lincoln's seeming failure to realize that &quot;the country was sleeping on a volcano&quot; and the South was &quot;'preparing for war.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;WTS Memoirs 185-86 (Lib. of America ed., 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fighting begins: 1861&amp;ndash;1862===
{{main|American Civil War}}
In April 1861, after Union troops at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] were fired upon and forced to surrender, Lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and &quot;preserve the Union,&quot; which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. [[Virginia]], which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Arkansas]].

The slave states of [[Missouri]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], and [[Delaware]] did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery. After the fighting started, he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas (especially in Maryland) and held in military prisons without trial. Over 18,000 were arrested, though none were executed. One, [[Clement Vallandigham]], was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (''see'': [[Ex parte Merryman]]).

===Emancipation Proclamation===
{{main|Abraham Lincoln on slavery|Emancipation Proclamation}}
{{Emancipation Proclamation draft}}
In July 1862, Congress moved to free the slaves by passing the Second Confiscation Act. The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. This new law was implemented with Lincoln's &quot;Emancipation Proclamation.&quot;

Ending slavery was always a primary goal of the Lincoln administration. However, the American public was slow to embrace the idea. In a shrewdly penned letter to Horace Greeley, editor of The New York Tribune, Lincoln masked his goal of ending slavery by making it subservient to the cause of preserving the union:

{{quote|I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be &quot;the Union as it was.&quot;&amp;nbsp;... My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views. I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htm|title=Letter to Horace Greeley|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Emancipation Proclamation]], announced on September 22 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all of them in Confederate hands (over three million) were freed. Lincoln later said: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.&quot; The proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. Lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/hodges.htm|title=Letter to Albert G. Hodges|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Online|date=[[1864-04-04]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1862, thirteen northern governors met in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]], at the Loyal [[War Governors' Conference]] to discuss the Proclamation and Union war effort. In the end, the state executives fully supported the president's Proclamation and also suggested the removal of General [[George B. McClellan]] as commander of the Union's [[Army of the Potomac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Altoona|author=Pulling, Anne Frances|publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]]|date=[[2001-06-11]]|isbn=0738505161|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery#Colonization|colonies]] for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. As [[Frederick Douglass]] observed, Lincoln was, &quot;The first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass|author=Douglass, Frederick|publisher=Digital Scanning|month=April |year=2001|isbn=1582183678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gettysburg Address===
{{main|Gettysburg Address}}
Although the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was a Union victory, it was also the bloodiest battle of the war and dealt a blow to Lincoln's war effort. As the Union Army decreased in numbers due to casualties, more soldiers were needed to replace the ranks. Lincoln's 1863 military drafts were considered &quot;odious&quot; among many in the north, particularly immigrants. The [[New York Draft Riots]] of July, 1863 were the most notable manifestation of this discontent.

Writing to Lincoln in September 1863, the [[Governor of Pennsylvania]], [[Andrew Curtin]], warned that political sentiments were turning against Lincoln and the war effort:

{{quote|If the election were to occur now, the result would be extremely doubtful, and although most of our discreet friends are sanguine of the result, my impression is, the chances would be against us. The draft is very odious in the State... the Democratic leaders have succeeded in exciting prejudice and passion, and have infused their poison into the minds of the people to a very large extent, and the changes are against us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mal:@field(DOCID+@lit(d2604300))|title=Andrew G. Curtin to Abraham Lincoln, Friday, September 4, 1863 (Politics in Pennsylvania) |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=[[1863-09-03]]|author=Curtin, Andrew G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the dedication of the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery|Soldiers' National Cemetery]] in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], on November 19, beginning with the now-iconic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/ge/GettysbuAd.html|title=Gettysburg Address|accessdate=2008-08-31|work=Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th Edition|month=May |year=2001|publisher=Columbia University Press via [[Bartleby.com]]|quote=It is one of the most famous and most quoted of modern speeches.}}&lt;/ref&gt; phrase &quot;Four [[20 (number)|score]] and seven years ago...&quot;, Lincoln referred to the events of the [[Civil War]] and described the ceremony at Gettysburg as an opportunity not only to dedicate the grounds of a cemetery, but also to consecrate the living in the struggle to ensure that &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth&quot;.

===1864 election and second inauguration===
{{main|United States presidential election, 1864}}
After Union victories at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga]] in 1863, overall victory seemed at hand, and Lincoln promoted [[Ulysses S. Grant]] General-in-Chief ( March 12, 1864). When the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates, Lincoln supported Grant's strategy of wearing down [[Robert E. Lee|Lee's]] Confederate army at the cost of heavy Union casualties. With an election looming, he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. At the Convention, the Republican Party selected [[Andrew Johnson]], a [[War Democrats|War Democrat]] from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. They ran on the new [[National Union Party (United States)|Union Party]] ticket uniting Republicans and War Democrats.

[[Image:Lincoln second.jpg|thumb|right|The only known photographs of Lincoln giving a speech were taken as he delivered his second inaugural address. Here, he stands in the center, with papers in his hand.]]

Nevertheless, Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Acknowledging this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Collapse of the Confederacy|author=Grimsley, Mark|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|date=[[2001-03-01]]|isbn=0803221703|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Basler|1955|p=514}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.

While the Democratic platform followed the [[Copperheads (politics)|Peace wing]] of the party and called the war a &quot;failure,&quot; their candidate, General [[George B. McClellan]], supported the war and repudiated the platform.

Lincoln provided Grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support Grant and win local support for the war effort. [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman's]] capture of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] in September ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln; the Union party was united and energized, and Lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. He won all but two states, capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.

On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]], his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was at hand, slavery was dead, and Lincoln was looking to the future.

{{quote|Fondly do we hope — fervently do we pray — that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said &quot;the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether.&quot; With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan — to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Basler|1955|p=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Conducting the war effort===
{{Refimprovesect|date=September 2008|lots of assertions (including several about Lincoln's state of mind ) &amp; there are only TWO references}}
[[Image:RunningtheMachine-LincAdmin.jpg|thumb|right|“Running the ‘Machine’”: An 1864 political cartoon featuring Lincoln; [[William P. Fessenden|William Fessenden]], [[Edwin M. Stanton|Edwin Stanton]], [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] and [[Gideon Welles]] take a swing at the Lincoln administration]]
The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and occupied nearly all of his time. He had a contentious relationship with General [[George B. McClellan|McClellan]], who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] and after the retirement of [[Winfield Scott]] in late 1861. Despite his inexperience in military affairs, Lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. His priorities were twofold: to ensure that Washington, D.C. was well defended; and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press. McClellan, a youthful [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service, took a more cautious approach. He took several months to plan and execute his [[Peninsula Campaign]], with the objective of capturing [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] by moving the [[Army of the Potomac]] by boat to the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[James River (Virginia)|James]] and [[York River (Virginia)|York Rivers]]. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.

McClellan, a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his ''Harrison's Landing Letter'', where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], a Republican, as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]]. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. But Pope was soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. In response to his failure, Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the [[Sioux]].

[[Image:A&amp;TLincoln.jpg|thumb|left|An 1864 [[Mathew Brady]] photo depicts President Lincoln reading a book with his youngest son, [[Tad Lincoln|Tad]]]]

Panicked by Lee's invasion of Maryland, Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the [[Battle of Antietam]] (September 1862). The ensuing Union victory enabled Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation, but he relieved McClellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican [[Ambrose Burnside]] to head the Army of the Potomac. Burnside had promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for a strong offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], [[Joseph Hooker]] was given the command, despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/hookbio.htm|title=Joseph Hooker|publisher=Civil War Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooker was routed by Lee at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] (May 1863), and relieved of command early in the subsequent [[Gettysburg Campaign]] replaced by [[George Meade]].

After the Union victory at Gettysburg, Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general, [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Grant already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including the battles of Vicksburg and [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga]]. Responding to criticism of Grant, Lincoln was quoted as saying, &quot;I cannot spare this man. He fights.&quot; Grant waged his bloody [[Overland Campaign]] in 1864 with a strategy of a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]], characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], but by proportionately higher Confederate losses. His invasion campaign eventually bottled Lee up in the [[Siege of Petersburg]], so that Grant could take Richmond, and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.

[[Image:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg|thumb|right|Lincoln, in a [[top hat]], with [[Allan Pinkerton]] and Major General [[John Alexander McClernand]] at Antietam]]
Lincoln authorized Grant to target civilians and infrastructure, hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. This allowed Generals [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]] and [[Philip Sheridan|Sheridan]] to destroy farms and towns in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and South Carolina. The damage caused by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by Sherman's own estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The United States: A History of the Republic|author=Davidson, James West|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|month=April |year=1990|isbn=0139436979|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in Ulysses S. Grant. Only then could he insist on using [[African American]] troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.

Throughout the war, Lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. He spent hours at the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] office, reading dispatches from his generals. He visited battle sites frequently, and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During [[Jubal Anderson Early]]'s [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raid on Washington, D.C.]] in 1864, Lincoln had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.

===Reconstruction===
{{main|Reconstruction era of the United States}}
Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. Lincoln led the &quot;moderates&quot; regarding Reconstructionist policy, and was usually opposed by the [[Radical Republican (USA)|Radical Republicans]], under [[Thaddeus Stevens]] in the House and [[Charles Sumner]] and [[Benjamin Wade]] in the Senate (though he cooperated with these men on most other issues). Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.bartleby.com/43/37.html|title=Proclamation of Amnesty|publisher=[[Bartleby.com]]|year=1863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. Of special importance were [[Tennessee]], where Lincoln appointed [[Andrew Johnson]] as governor, and [[Louisiana]], where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10% of the voters agreed to it. The Radicals thought this policy too lenient, and passed their own plan, the [[Wade-Davis Bill]], in 1864. When Lincoln [[Pocket veto|pocket-vetoed]] the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1995|loc=&amp;sect;20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the war, Lincoln made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to visit Richmond after it was taken by the Union forces and to make a public gesture of sitting at [[Jefferson Davis|Jefferson Davis's]] own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, &quot;I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.&quot; When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, &quot;Let 'em up easy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1995|pp=576, 580}};{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/richmond.htm|title=President Lincoln Enters Richmond, 1865|publisher=Eyewitness to History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln arrived back in Washington on the evening of April 9, 1865, the day Lee surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House]] in Virginia. The war was effectively over. The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelincolnlog.org/view/show_date?day=09&amp;month=04&amp;year=1865|title=The Lincoln Log, April 9, 1865.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home front==
===Redefining Republicanism===
[[Image:Abraham Lincoln half length seated, April 10, 1865.jpg|thumb|right|One of the last photographs of Lincoln, likely taken in February 1865]]
Lincoln's [[rhetoric]] defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. The [[Gettysburg Address]] defied Lincoln's own prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.&quot; His second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted.

In recent years, historians have stressed Lincoln's use of and redefinition of [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]], Lincoln shifted emphasis to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] as the foundation of American political values — what he called the &quot;sheet anchor&quot; of republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffa|2000|p= 399}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential [[Cooper Union speech]], &quot;Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-Interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism|author=Diggins, John P.|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|date=[[1986-08-15]]|isbn=0226148777|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foner|1970|p= 215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McPherson|1992|pp=61–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a &quot;republican form of government&quot; in every state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffa|2000|p= 263}}&lt;/ref&gt; That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].

In his [[Gettysburg Address]] Lincoln redefined the American nation, arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776, &quot;conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&quot; He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality, &quot;that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.&quot; By emphasizing the centrality of the nation, he rebuffed the claims of [[state sovereignty]]. While some critics say Lincoln moved too far and too fast, they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked &quot;a new founding of the nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|1993|p= 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil liberties suspended===
During the Civil War, Lincoln appropriated powers no previous President had wielded: he used his war powers to proclaim a [[Union blockade|blockade]], suspended the writ of [[habeas corpus]], spent money without congressional authorization, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial.

===Domestic measures===
Lincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws while he signed them, [[veto]]ing only those bills that threatened his war powers. Thus, he signed the [[Homestead Act]] in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], also signed in 1862, provided government grants for [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[university|universities]] in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which was completed in 1869. Other important legislation involved economic matters, including the first [[income tax]] and higher [[tariff]]s. Also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the [[National Banking Act]]s of 1863, 1864, and 1865, which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. Congress created and Lincoln approved the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] in 1862, although that institution would not become a Cabinet-level department until 1889.

The Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the [[United States Note]], the first [[banknote|paper currency]] in United States history. This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.

During the war, Lincoln's [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] effectively controlled all [[cotton]] trade in the occupied South — the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.

In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], to put down the &quot;[[Dakota War of 1862|Sioux Uprising]]&quot; in [[Minnesota]]. Presented with 303 [[death warrant]]s for convicted [[Santee|Santee Dakota]] who had massacred innocent farmers, Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for [[death penalty|execution]] (one was later [[reprieve]]d).

==Medical history==
Illnesses included: [[frostbite|frostbitten]] feet, [[malaria]], [[physical trauma]] and [[smallpox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.doctorzebra.com/prez/g16.htm|title=Maladies and Conditions|publisher=Doctor Zebra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims that Lincoln had [[syphilis]] about 1835 have been controversial, but a recent analysis finds them credible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vidal, Gore|title=Communications|journal=[[American Historical Review]]|month=February |year=1991|pages=324–326}} See also: {{cite journal|author=Fehrenbacher, Don E.|title=Communications|journal=[[American Historical Review]]|month=February |year=1991|pages=326–328}} and {{cite book|author=Sotos, JG|title=The Physical Lincoln Sourcebook|location=[[Mount Vernon]], [[Virginia|VA]]|publisher=Mt. Vernon Book Systems|year=2008|pages=318–326|url=http://www.physical-lincoln.com/contents-pls.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Lincoln was tall for his age. He reached his adult height of {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m}} no later than age 21. Friends noticed his arms, legs, hands, and feet were long. Although well muscled as a young adult, he was always thin. Fragmentary evidence says he weighed around 170&amp;nbsp;pounds before the Presidency, but lost weight while in the White House. Based on Lincoln's unusual physical appearance, Dr. Abraham Gordon proposed in 1962 that Lincoln had [[Marfan syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gordon AM. Abraham Lincoln|journal=Kentucky Medical Association|month=March |year=1962|issue=60|pages=249–53|pmid= 13900423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's unremarkable [[cardiovascular]] history and his normal visual acuity have been the chief objections to the theory, and today the diagnosis is considered unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Was George Washington Really the Father of Our Country?: A Clinical Geneticist Looks at World History |author=Marion, Robert|publisher=Perseus Books |month=February |year=1994|isbn=0201622556|pages=88–124}} See also: {{cite journal|author=Ready, Tinker |title=Access to presidential DNA denied|journal=[[Nature Medicine]]|year=1999|volume=5|issue=859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing Lincoln's [[DNA]] for Marfan syndrome was contemplated in the 1990s, but such a test was not performed.

In 2007, Dr. John Sotos proposed that Lincoln had [[multiple endocrine neoplasia]], type 2B (MEN2B).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sotos, JG|title=The Physical Lincoln: Finding the Genetic Cause of Abraham Lincoln's Height, Homeliness, Pseudo-Depression, and Imminent Cancer Death|location=[[Mount Vernon]], [[Virginia|VA]]|publisher=Mt. Vernon Book Systems|year=2008|url=http://www.physical-lincoln.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests Lincoln had all the major features of the disease: a marfan-like body shape, large, bumpy lips, [[constipation]], [[hypotonia]], a history compatible with [[cancer]] and a family history of the disorder - his sons [[Edward Baker Lincoln|Eddie]], [[William Wallace Lincoln|Willie]], and [[Tad Lincoln|Tad]], and probably his mother. The &quot;mole&quot; on Lincoln's right cheek, the asymmetry of his face, his large jaw, his drooping eyelid, and &quot;pseudo-depression&quot; are also suggested as manifestations of MEN2B. Lincoln's longevity is the principal challenge to the MEN2B theory, which could be proven by DNA testing.

==Assassination==
{{main|Abraham Lincoln assassination}}

[[Image:The Assassination of President Lincoln - Currier and Ives 2.png|right|thumb|The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: [[Henry Rathbone]], [[Clara Harris]], Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and [[John Wilkes Booth]]]]

Originally, [[John Wilkes Booth]], a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, had formulated a plan to [[kidnapping|kidnap]] Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harrison, Lowell Hayes|title=Lincoln of Kentucky|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|year=2000|pages=3–4|isbn=0813121566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning that the President and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] would be attending [[Ford's Theatre]], he laid his plans, assigning his co-conspirators to assassinate [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]].

Without his main bodyguard [[Ward Hill Lamon]], to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination, Lincoln left to attend the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' on April 14, 1865. As a lone bodyguard wandered, and Lincoln sat in his state box (Box 7) in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President and waited for what he thought would be the funniest line of the play (&quot;You sock-dologizing old man-trap&quot;), hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. When the laughter began, Booth jumped into the box and aimed a single-shot, round-slug 0.44 caliber [[Henry Deringer]] at his head, firing at point-blank range. Major [[Henry Rathbone]] momentarily grappled with Booth but was cut by Booth's knife. Booth then leapt to the stage and shouted &quot;''[[Sic semper tyrannis]]!''&quot; ({{lang-la|Thus always to tyrants}}) and escaped, despite a broken leg suffered in the leap.&lt;ref name=Townsend&gt;{{cite book|author=Townsend, George Alfred|title=The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth|location=[[New York]]|publisher=[[Dick and Fitzgerald]]|year=1865}}&lt;/ref&gt; A twelve-day manhunt ensued, in which Booth was chased by Federal agents (under the direction of [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]). He was eventually cornered in a Virginia barn house and shot, dying of his wounds soon after.

[[Image:LincolnTrain.jpeg|thumb|left|Lincoln's [[funeral train]] carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son, William, 1,654&amp;nbsp;miles (2,661&amp;nbsp;km) to Illinois]]
An army surgeon, Doctor [[Charles Leale]], initially assessed Lincoln's wound as [[Mortal Wound|mortal]]. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the [[Ford's Theatre#Petersen House|Petersen House]], where he lay in a coma for nine hours before dying. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|U.S. Army Surgeon General]] Joseph K. Barnes of the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine|Army Medical Museum]]. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged 6&amp;nbsp;inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) inside his brain. Lincoln never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead at 7:22:10 a.m. April 15, 1865. There is some disagreement among historians as to Stanton's words after Lincoln died. All agree that he began &quot;Now he belongs to the...&quot; with some stating he said &quot;ages&quot; while others believe he said &quot;angels.&quot;&lt;ref name=Townsend /&gt; After Lincoln's body was returned to the [[White House]], a brain-only autopsy was performed, and his body was prepared for his [[lying in repose]] in the [[East Room]]. He was the first president to be assassinated or to [[Lying in state|lie in state]].

The Army Medical Museum, now named the National Museum of Health and Medicine, has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. Currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the [[Philadelphia Deringer]] pistol, the probe used by Barnes, pieces of Lincoln's skull and hair, and the surgeon's cuff stained with Lincoln's blood. The chair in which Lincoln was shot is on display at the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].

Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois.&lt;ref name=Townsend /&gt; While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the United States, [[copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] celebrated the death of a man they considered a tyrant. The [[Lincoln Tomb]] in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, is 177&amp;nbsp;feet (54&amp;nbsp;m) tall and, by 1874, was surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] had Lincoln [[Burial#Exhumation|exhumed]] and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.

==Presidential appointments==
===Administration and cabinet===
Lincoln was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party — and to let them battle each other and not combine against him. Historians agree that, except for [[Simon Cameron]], it was a highly effective group.

==Religious and philosophical beliefs==
{{see|Abraham Lincoln and religion}}
In March 1860 in a speech in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], Lincoln said, with respect to slavery, “Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained.&quot; The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined &quot;seriously as a man of ideas.&quot; Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] version of [[liberalism|liberal]] [[capitalism]] who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by &quot;an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.&quot; It was Lincoln’s reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs.&lt;ref name = &quot;zsafth&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|2002|pp=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln did, even as a boy, largely reject [[religion|organized religion]], but the [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] &quot;doctrine of necessity&quot; would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as &quot;that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1995|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1864, in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, &quot;I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1995|p=514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Lincoln matured, and especially during his term as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1999|pp=251–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary:

{{quote|The [[will (philosophy)|will]] of God prevails. In great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be, wrong. God cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time. In the present civil war it is quite possible that God's purpose is something different from the purpose of either party&amp;mdash;and yet the human instrumentalities, working just as they do, are of the best adaptation to effect his purpose. I am almost ready to say this is probably true&amp;mdash;that God wills this contest, and wills that it shall not end yet. By his mere quiet power, on the minds of the now contestants, He could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1999|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lincoln’s religious [[skepticism]] was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the [[John Locke|Lockean]] [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and classical liberalism, especially [[economic liberalism]].&lt;ref name = &quot;zsafth&quot;/&gt; Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party, Lincoln would often use the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a February 22, 1861 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia Lincoln said,

{{quote|I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence.&amp;nbsp;… It was not the mere matter of the separation of the Colonies from the motherland; but that sentiment in the Declaration of Independence which gave liberty, not alone to the people of this country, but, I hope, to the world, for all future time. It was that which gave promise that in due time the weight would be lifted from the shoulders of all men. This is a sentiment embodied in the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffa|2000|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] platform of the [[Know Nothing]]s. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|pp=194–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the Declaration of Independence, rather than the Bible, that Lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|2002|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's death made the President a [[martyr]] to many. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|greatest presidents in U.S. history]], often appearing in the first position. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general.

Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]]-supporting [[Log Cabin Republicans]] to the [[insurance]] corporation [[Lincoln National Corporation]]. The [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln automobile]] is also named after him. The [[ballistic missile]] [[submarine]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602)|''Abraham Lincoln'' (SSBN-602)]] and the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|''Abraham Lincoln'' (CVN-72)]] were named in his honor. Also, the [[Liberty ship]] SS ''Nancy Hanks'' was named for his mother. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the American faction of the [[International Brigades]] named themselves the [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]].

Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the [[Lincoln, Nebraska|capital of Nebraska]]. [[Lincoln, Illinois]], is the only city to be named for Abraham Lincoln before he became President. Lincoln's name and image appear in numerous places. These include the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in Washington, D.C., the U.S. [[United States five-dollar bill|Lincoln $5 bill]] and the [[Lincoln cent]], Lincoln's sculpture on the [[Mount Rushmore]], and the [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site]] in Springfield, Illinois. In addition, [[New Salem, Menard County, Illinois|New Salem, Illinois]] (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), [[Ford's Theatre]], and Petersen House (where he died) are all preserved as museums. The Lincoln Shrine in [[Redlands, California]], is located behind the A.K. Smiley Public Library. The [[List of U.S. state nicknames|state nickname]] for Illinois is ''Land of Lincoln''.

[[County (United States)|Counties]] in 18 [[U.S. state]]s ([[Lincoln County, Arkansas|Arkansas]], [[Lincoln County, Colorado|Colorado]], [[Lincoln County, Idaho|Idaho]], [[Lincoln County, Kansas|Kansas]], [[Lincoln County, Maine|Maine]], [[Lincoln County, Minnesota|Minnesota]], [[Lincoln County, Mississippi|Mississippi]], [[Lincoln County, Montana|Montana]], [[Lincoln County, Nebraska|Nebraska]], [[Lincoln County, Nevada|Nevada]], [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|New Mexico]], [[Lincoln County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma]], [[Lincoln County, Oregon|Oregon]], [[Lincoln County, South Dakota|South Dakota]], [[Lincoln County, West Virginia|West Virginia]], [[Lincoln County, Washington|Washington]], [[Lincoln County, Wisconsin|Wisconsin]], and [[Lincoln County, Wyoming|Wyoming]]) are named after Lincoln.

Abraham Lincoln's birthday, February 12, was formerly a national holiday, now commemorated as [[Presidents Day (United States)|Presidents' Day]]. However, it is still observed in Illinois and many other states as a separate legal holiday, [[Lincoln's Birthday]]. A dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third Monday in February as 'Presidents' Day' as a combination Washington-Lincoln Day.

To commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in February 2009, Congress established the [[Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission]] (ALBC) in 2000. Dedicated to renewing American appreciation of Lincoln’s legacy, the 15-member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an advisory board of over 130 various Lincoln historians and enthusiasts. Located at [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[ALBC]] is the organizing force behind numerous tributes, programs and cultural events highlighting a two-year celebration scheduled to begin in February 2008 at Lincoln’s birthplace: [[Hodgenville]], [[Kentucky]].

Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site]] in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. The [[Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum]] opened in Springfield in 2005; it is a major tourist attraction, with state-of-the-art exhibits. The [[Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery]] is located in [[Elwood, Illinois]].

He gained prominence in the 1970s for playing  Jodie Dallas on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' and became a [[Hollywood]] film star during the late 1980s and 1990s, appearing in the box office successes ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' and ''[[City Slickers]]''.  

==Background==
Crystal was born in the Doctor's Hospital in [[Manhattan]] and grew up in [[Long Beach, New York]], the son of Helen ([[married and maiden names|née]] Gabler), a housewife, and Jack Crystal, a record company executive and producer of [[jazz]] records, who owned and operated the Commodore Record store.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmr&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Billy Crystal Biography | url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/61/Billy-Crystal.html | work=filmreference.com | accessdate=2008-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/articles/arti0102_03.htm | title=Jack Crystal: A Man To Remember | first=Joe | last=Kane | accessdate=2008-01-16 | work=Allaboutjazz}}&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle was musician and songwriter [[Milt Gabler]], and his brother, Richard Crystal, is a television producer. Crystal grew up in a [[Jew]]ish family that he has described as &quot;large&quot; and &quot;loving&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/06/sunday/main1015865.shtml | date=2005-11-06 | title=Life Is Short, Laugh Hard | work=CBS News | first=Rita | last=Braver}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation from [[Long Beach High School (New York)|Long Beach High School]], Crystal attended [[Marshall University]] in Huntington, West Virginia, on a baseball scholarship, having learned the game from his father, who pitched for [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]].  Crystal never played a game at Marshall because the program was suspended during his freshman year and he didn't return as a sophomore, staying back in New York with his future wife.  Later, he attended [[New York University]] and [[Nassau Community College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800015850/bio | title=Billy Crystal Biography | work=Yahoo! Movies | accessdate = 2008-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Crystal has been married to Janice Goldfinger, whom he met when he was 18 and she 17, since 1970.  They have two daughters, actresses Jennifer and Lindsay, and are now grandparents. They reside in Pacific Palisades, California.

==Career==
===Television===
Crystal returned to New York and performed regularly at ''[[The Improv]]'' and ''[[Catch a Rising Star]]''. He studied film and television direction under [[Martin Scorsese]] at [[New York University]]. Crystal's earliest prominent role was as Jodie Dallas on ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'', one of the first gay characters portrayed on American television. In 1976, Crystal appeared on an episode of ''[[All in the Family]]''. He was scheduled to appear on the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' ([[October 11]], [[1975]]), but his sketch was cut.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Billy Crystal, 2nd Visit | series = Inside the Actors Studio | airdate = 2007-10-08 | url = http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guest/Billy_Crystal_-_2nd_Visit | network = Bravo | season = 13 | number = 1307 | credits = Lipton, James (host)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did do a stand-up bit later on that first season as &quot;Bill Crystal&quot;, on the [[April 17]], [[1976]], episode. After hosting a show years later, in 1984, he joined the cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; His most famous recurring sketch was his parody of [[Fernando Lamas]]{{ndash}} Fernando, a smarmy talk show host whose [[catch phrase]], &quot;You look... mahvelous!,&quot; became a media sensation.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt;

Crystal's first film role was in [[Joan Rivers]]'s 1978 film ''[[Rabbit Test (film)|Rabbit Test]]''. Crystal also made game show appearances such as ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]'' and ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $20,000 Pyramid]]''. He holds the record for getting his contestant partner to the top of the pyramid in the bonus round in the fastest time, 26 seconds. 

Crystal hosted the [[Academy Awards]] broadcast in 1990&amp;ndash;1993, 1997, 1998, 2000, and 2004; and he reportedly turned down the opportunity to host the 2006 ceremony to concentrate on his one-man show, ''700 Sundays''. His eight times as the emcee is second only to legendary Oscar host [[Bob Hope]] in most ceremonies hosted.

===Film===
Crystal appeared briefly in [[Rob Reiner]]'s 1984 &quot;[[rockumentary]]&quot; ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' as Morty The Mime, a waiter dressed as a mime at one of Spinal Tap's parties. He shared the scene with a then-unknown, non-speaking [[Dana Carvey]]. Crystal's memorable line in the film was &quot;Mime is money.&quot; Eventually, Reiner directed Crystal again in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', and then in the romantic comedy ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'', for which Crystal was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]]. Crystal also appeared in the box-office hit ''[[City Slickers]]'' (1991).

Crystal wrote, directed, and starred in ''[[Mr. Saturday Night]]'' (1992) and ''[[Forget Paris]]'' (1995). In the former, Crystal played a serious role in aging makeup, as an egotistical comedian who reflects back on his career. He directed the made-for-television movie ''[[61*]]'' (2001) based on [[Roger Maris]]'s and [[Mickey Mantle]]'s race to break [[Babe Ruth]]'s single-season home run record in 1961. This earned Crystal an [[Emmy]] nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special.

Crystal has continued working in film, including the popular ''[[Analyze This]]'' (1999) and ''[[Analyze That]]'' (2002) with [[Robert De Niro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; Crystal lent his voice to the character [[Mike Wazowski]] in [[Pixar]]'s animated feature film ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; and in the English version of ''Howl's Moving Castle'' as the voice of [[Calcifer]]. Pixar originally approached him to provide the voice of [[Buzz Lightyear]] in ''[[Toy Story]]''. He turned down that offer, but regretted it after the film became one of the most popular releases of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt;

===Broadway===
Crystal won the 2005 [[Tony Award]] for Best Special Theatrical Event for ''700 Sundays'', a two-act, one-man play, which he conceived and wrote about his parents and his childhood growing up on [[Long Island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; He toured the U.S. with the show in 2006 and Australia in 2007.

Following the initial success of the play, Crystal wrote the book ''700 Sundays'' for [[Warner Books]], which was published on [[October 31]], [[2005]]. In conjunction with the book and the play that also paid tribute to his uncle, [[Milt Gabler]], Crystal produced two CD compilations: ''Billy Crystal Presents: The Milt Gabler Story'', which featured his uncle's most influential recordings from [[Billie Holiday]]'s &quot;[[Strange Fruit]]&quot; to &quot;[[Rock Around the Clock]]&quot; by [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets]]; and ''Billy Remembers Billie'' featuring Crystal's favorite Holiday recordings.

===Philanthropy===
In 1986, Crystal started hosting ''[[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]'' on [[Home Box Office|HBO]] with [[Robin Williams]] and [[Whoopi Goldberg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; Founded by [[Bob Zmuda]], Comic Relief raises money for [[homeless]] people in the [[United States]].

On [[September 6]], [[2005]], on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|The Tonight Show]]'', Crystal and [[Jay Leno]] were the first celebrities to sign a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle to be auctioned off for Gulf Coast relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=The Associated Press.title=Leno's autographed bike raises $500,000 | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-09-30-leno-bike_x.htm | work= USAToday | date=2005-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal has also participated in the Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles. Portraying himself in a video, Crystal introduces museum guests to the genealogy wing of the museum.

===New York Yankees===
On [[March 12]], {{by|2008}}, Crystal signed a minor league contract, for a single day, to play with the [[New York Yankees]], and was invited to the team's major league spring training. Billy wore uniform number 60, in honor of his upcoming 60th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Billy Crystal to sign contract with Yankees | url = http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news;_ylt=ApQysfnqvYEYnzAzS7waMwc5nYcB?slug=ap-yankees-crystal&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns| publisher = Yahoo | date = 2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[March 13]], in a spring training game against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], Crystal led off as the [[designated hitter]]. He managed to make contact, fouling a [[fastball]] up the [[first base]] line, but was eventually struck out by Pirates pitcher [[Paul Maholm]] on 6 pitches and was later replaced in the batting order by [[Johnny Damon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080313&amp;content_id=2423946&amp;vkey=spt2008news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy Crystal strikes out in only at-bat]&lt;/ref&gt; He was released on [[March 14]], his 60th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/7908990?MSNHPHMA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In addition to his [[Golden Globe Award]]-nominations, [[Emmy Awards]], and [[Tony Award]], Crystal is the 2007 recipient of the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Billy Crystal, Clearly Funny | publisher = The Washington Post | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/01/AR2007050101252.html | date = 2007-05-02 | first = Jacqueline | last = Trescott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Jefferson &quot;Bill&quot; Clinton''' (born '''William Jefferson Blythe III''', August 19, 1946)&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse.gov bio&quot;&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/bc42.html Biography of William J. Clinton], ''[[The White House]]''&lt;/ref&gt; served as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|forty-second]] [[President of the United States]] from 1993 to 2001. He was the fifteenth Democrat elected to that office. He was the [[List of United States presidents by age at ascension to office|third-youngest president]], older only than [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[John F. Kennedy]]. He became president at the end of the [[Cold War]], and as he was born in the period after [[World War II]], is known as the first [[Baby Boomer]] president.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Sandalow, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/01/14/MN71509.DTL Clinton Era Marked by Scandal, Prosperity: 1st Baby Boomer in White House Changed Notions of Presidency], San Francisco Chronicle; January 14, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; His wife is the [[New York]] [[United States Senator|Senator]], [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]].

Clinton left office with an [[approval rating]] at 65%, the highest end of office rating of any President since [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;http://uspolitics.about.com/od/polls/l/bl_historical_approval.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Clinton has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. To promote and address international causes, such as treatment and prevention of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] and [[global warming]], he created the [[William J. Clinton Foundation]].

In 2004, he released his autobiography, ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'', and more recently has been involved in his wife Hillary's [[Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]] and in that of [[Barack Obama]].

== Early life ==
[[Image:William Jefferson Blythe 1950.jpg|thumb|upright|right|William Jefferson Blythe, III, in 1950 at age four. Known at the time as Billy, he did not formally adopt his stepfather's name until age fourteen.]]

[[Image:Bill Clinton Boyhood Home in Hope, Arkansas IMG 1515.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Bill Clinton Boyhood Home in [[Hope, Arkansas]]]]

Bill Clinton was born &quot;William Jefferson Blythe III&quot; in [[Hope, Arkansas|Hope]], [[Arkansas]]. His father, [[William Jefferson Blythe, Jr.]], was a traveling [[salesman]] who died in an [[automobile]] accident three months before Bill was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse.gov bio&quot; /&gt;  Following his birth, in order to study nursing, his mother [[Virginia Clinton Kelley|Virginia Dell Cassidy]] (1923-1994), traveled to [[New Orleans]], leaving Bill in Hope with grandparents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and operated a small [[grocery store]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://immigration.about.com/library/blbillclinton.htm About.com article]&lt;/ref&gt;  At a time when the [[Southern United States]] were [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]], Bill's grandparents sold goods on [[Credit (finance)|credit]] to people of all racial groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://immigration.about.com/library/blbillclinton.htm About.com article]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and shortly thereafter married [[Roger Clinton, Sr.|Roger Clinton]], who together with his brother owned an [[Car dealership|automobile dealership]] in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot;&gt;My Life, Bill Clinton, Random House, 2004, ISBN 0-375-41457-6&lt;/ref&gt;  The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.

Although he assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Billy (as he was known then) turned fourteen that he formally adopted the surname Clinton, partially as a gesture toward his stepfather.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;  Clinton says he remembers his stepfather as a [[gambler]] and an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who regularly abused his mother and, at times, his half-brother, [[Roger Clinton, Jr.|Roger, Jr.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot;&gt;First In His Class : A Biography Of Bill Clinton, David Maraniss, Random House, 1996, ISBN 978-0684818900&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them.

== Education ==
In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and [[Hot Springs High School (Arkansas)|Hot Springs High School]] - where he was an active student leader, avid [[reader]], and [[musician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first=
|title=President Bill Clinton's Hometown Homepage |publisher= |url=http://www.hotspringsar.com/info/clinton/ |accessdate=2007-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was in the chorus and played the [[tenor saxophone]], winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to [[music]], but as he noted in his [[autobiography]] ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'':

{{cquote|(…) Sometime in my sixteenth year I decided I wanted to be in public life as an elected official. I loved music and thought I could be very good, but I knew I would never be [[John Coltrane]] or [[Stan Getz]]. I was interested in medicine and thought I could be a fine doctor, but I knew I would never be [[Michael E. DeBakey|Michael DeBakey]]. But I knew I could be great in public service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clinton |first=Bill |title=My Life |publisher=Knopf |date=June 22, 2004 |location= |pages=52 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1963, two influential moments in Clinton's life contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit to the [[White House]] to meet President [[John F. Kennedy]], as a [[Boys Nation]] senator.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; The other was listening to [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King's]] 1963 ''[[I Have a Dream]]'' speech (he memorized Dr. King's words).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=It All Began in a Place Called Hope |publisher= |url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/Hope.html |accessdate=2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Clinton at Georgetown 1967.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Clinton attended the School of Foreign Service at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington D.C.]], receiving a degree in 1968, during which he ran for [[President]] of the Student Council.]]

With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], receiving a [[List of tagged degrees|Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service]] ([[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]][[Diplomatic service|F.S.]]) degree in 1968. He spent the summer of 1967, the summer before his senior year, working as an [[intern]] for Arkansas [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[J. William Fulbright]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; While in college he became a brother of [[Alpha Phi Omega]] and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/org/649/000041526/|title=Clinton, brother of Alpha Phi Omega}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clinton was also a member of Youth Order of [[DeMolay International|DeMolay]], but he never actually became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Famous Non-Masons |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.masonicinfo.com/famousnon.htm |accessdate=2006-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of [[Kappa Kappa Psi]]'s National Honorary Band Fraternity, Inc.

Upon graduation he won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[University College, Oxford]] where he studied [[Government]].&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; He developed an interest in [[rugby union]], playing at Oxford and later for the Little Rock Rugby club in Arkansas. While at Oxford he also participated in [[Vietnam War]] [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|protests]], including organizing an October 1969 [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Moratorium]] event.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; In later life he admitted to smoking [[cannabis]] at the university, but claimed that he &quot;never inhaled&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In ''My Life'', Clinton claims this comment wasn't intended to mitigate the admission and he doesn't know why he added it.&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;

After Oxford, Clinton attended [[Yale Law School]] and obtained a [[Juris Doctor]] ([[J.D.]]) degree in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; While at Yale, he began dating law student [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Rodham]] who was a year ahead of him. They married in 1975 and their only child, [[Chelsea Clinton|Chelsea]], was born in 1980.

==Early political career==
===Leader of Texas McGovern Presidential Campaign of 1972===
During Yale, Clinton took a job with the [[George McGovern|McGovern]] campaign and was assigned to lead McGovern's effort in Texas.  He spent considerable time in Dallas, Texas, at the McGovern campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue where he had an office. There, Clinton worked with [[Ron Kirk]], who was later elected mayor of Dallas twice, future governor of Texas [[Ann Richards]], and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker) [[Steven Spielberg]].

===Governor of Arkansas===
After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a professor at the [[University of Arkansas]]. A year later, he ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 1974. The incumbent, [[John Paul Hammerschmidt]], defeated Clinton by a 52% to 48% margin. Without opposition in the general election, Clinton was elected [[Arkansas]] [[Attorney General]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;
{{see|Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1978}}

[[Image:Bill Clinton 1978.jpg|thumb|left|Clinton, as the newly elected [[Governor of Arkansas]] meeting with President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1978.]]
Clinton was elected [[Governor of Arkansas]] in 1978, making him the youngest governor in the country at age thirty-two. He worked on educational reform and Arkansas's roads, but his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of [[Cuba]]n refugees (from the [[Mariel boatlift]]) detained in [[Fort Chaffee]] in 1980. [[Monroe Schwarzlose]] of [[Kingsland, Arkansas|Kingsland]] in [[Cleveland County, Arkansas|Cleveland County]], polled 31% of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat in the general election that year by [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challenger [[Frank D. White]]. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;
{{see|Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1980}}

Clinton joined friend's [[Bruce Lindsey]]'s law firm of [http://www.wlj.com/ Wright, Lindsey and Jennings], though he spent most of the next two years working on his re-election campaign. Clinton was again elected governor and kept his job for ten years. He helped [[Arkansas]] transform its [[economy]] and significantly improve the state's educational system. He became a leading figure among the [[New Democrats]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot;&gt;''The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton'', [[Joe Klein]], 2003, ISBN 0-7679-1412-0&lt;/ref&gt; The New Democrats, organized within the [[Democratic Leadership Council|Democratic Leadership Council (DLC)]] were a branch of the Democratic Party that called for welfare reform and smaller government, a policy supported by both Democrats and Republicans. He served as Chair of the [[National Governors Association]] from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;

Clinton made economic growth, job creation and educational improvement high priorities. For [[senior citizens]], he removed the [[sales tax]] from [[medicine]] and increased the home property tax exemption. Clinton was responsible for some state educational improvement programs, notably more spending for schools, rising opportunities for gifted children, an increase in vocational education, and raising of teachers' salaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt;

Clinton's Governorship answered conservative criticism, but personal and business transactions made by the Clintons during this period became the basis of the [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater]] investigation, which dogged his later presidential administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clinton Wars&quot;&gt;The Clinton Wars, ISBN 0-374-12502-3, 2003, ISBN ISBN 0-374-12502-3&lt;/ref&gt; After very extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot;&gt;''The Survivor: Bill Clinton in the White House'', John F. Harris , 2005, ISBN 0-375-50847-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic Presidential Primaries of 1988===
[[Image:Reagans with the Clintons.jpg|thumb|right|Governor and Mrs. Clinton attend the Dinner Honoring the Nation's Governors in the [[White House]] with President [[Ronald Reagan]] and first lady [[Nancy Reagan]], 1987]]
In 1987 there was media speculation Clinton would enter the race after then-[[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Mario Cuomo]] declined to run and Democratic front-runner [[Gary Hart]] withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot;&gt;David Maraniss, ''First in His Class: A Biography of Bill Clinton'' (New York: Random House, 1996; ISBN 978-0684818900).&lt;/ref&gt; For the nomination, Clinton endorsed [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Michael Dukakis]]. However, he gave the opening night address at the [[1988 Democratic National Convention]], which was nationally-televised, but it was criticized for length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Church|first=George J.|title=Cover: Is Bill Clinton For Real?|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,974739,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1992-01-27|accessdate=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presenting himself as a moderate and a member of the [[New Democrat]] wing of the Democratic Party, he headed the moderate [[Democratic Leadership Council]] in 1990 and 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot;&gt;[[Joe Klein]], ''The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton'' (&lt;!--Publisher, etc.?--&gt;2003; ISBN 0-7679-1412-0).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choie&quot;&gt;[[Bob Woodward]], ''The Choice: How Clinton Won'' (&lt;!--Publisher, etc.?--&gt;1996; ISBN 0-684-81308-4).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Democratic Presidential Primaries of 1992====
{{see|Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1992}}
Due to his youthful appearance he was often called the &quot;''Boy Governor''.&quot; In the first contest, the [[Iowa caucus]], he finished a very distant third to Iowa Senator [[Tom Harkin]]. During the campaign for the [[New Hampshire Primary]] reports of an extramarital affair with [[Gennifer Flowers]] surfaced. As Clinton fell far behind former [[Massachusetts]] Senator [[Paul Tsongas]] in the New Hampshire polls,&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; following the [[Super Bowl]], Clinton and his wife Hillary went on ''[[60 Minutes]]''  to refute the charges.

====&quot;The Comeback Kid&quot;====
Their television appearance was a calculated risk but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the [[New Hampshire primary]], but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. On election night, Clinton labeled himself &quot;''The Comeback Kid''.&quot; He ended leading New Hampshire by a large percentage. However, Tsongas picked up little or no momentum from his victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;

Winning the big prizes of [[Florida]] and [[Texas]] and many of the [[Southern United States|Southern primaries]] gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former [[California]] Governor [[Jerry Brown]] was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside of his native South.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choie&quot; /&gt;

With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted the New York primary, which contained a large number of delegates. He scored a resounding victory in [[New York City]] and won, shedding his image as a regional candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choie&quot; /&gt; Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in [[Jerry Brown]]'s home state of [[California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;

===Presidential Election===
[[Image:Debates.jpg|thumb|right|Bill Clinton with H. [[Ross Perot]], Independent, and President [[George H.W. Bush]], [[Republican party (United States)|Republican]], in a national debate.]]

{{main|United States presidential election, 1992}}
{{see also|Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992}}

Clinton won the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] (43.0% of the vote) against Republican incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]] (37.4% of the vote) and billionaire [[Populism|populist]] [[Ross Perot|H. Ross Perot]], who ran as an independent (18.9% of the vote) on a platform focusing on domestic issues; a significant part of Clinton's success was Bush's steep decline in public approval. Because Bush's [[approval rating]]s were in the 80% range during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf conflict]], he was described as &quot;unbeatable.&quot;  However, when Bush compromised with Democrats in an attempt to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his [[Read my lips: no new taxes|promise not to raise taxes]], hurting his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choie&quot;&gt;''The choice: how Clinton won'', [[Bob Woodward]], 1996, ISBN 0-684-81308-4&lt;/ref&gt; By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to slightly over 40%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-presapp0605-31.html WSJ.com&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choice&quot;&gt;''The choice: how Clinton won,'' [[Bob Woodward]],1996, ISBN 0-684-81308-4&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-[[communism]], but with the end of the [[Cold War]], the party lacked a uniting issue. When [[Pat Buchanan]] and [[Pat Robertson]] addressed Christian themes
at the [[1992 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]], with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform, many moderates were alienated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Le Beau|first=Bryan|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Political Mobilization of the New Christian Right|work= |publisher=[[Creighton University]]|date= |url=http://are.as.wvu.edu/lebeau1.htm|format= |doi= |accessdate=2006-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton then pointed to his moderate, &quot;New Democrat&quot; record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Walker |first=Martin |title=Tough love child of Kennedy |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1240962,00.html |accessdate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Democrats who supported [[Ronald Reagan]] and Bush in previous elections switched their allegiance to Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/4/newsid_3659000/3659498.stm|title=Clinton beats Bush to the White House, BBC News, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the [[White House]], and twenty of the previous twenty four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse.gov bio&quot;/&gt; Clinton was the first president to enjoy this windfall since [[Jimmy Carter]] in the late 1970s.

However, during the campaign questions of [[conflict of interest]] regarding state business and the politically powerful [[Rose Law Firm]], at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose.  Clinton maintained questions were moot because all transactions with the state were deducted prior to determining Hillary's firm pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ifill|first=Gwen|title=Hillary Clinton Defends Her Conduct in Law Firm|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1D61039F934A25750C0A964958260|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1992-03-17|accessdate=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot;/&gt; Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that voters would be getting two presidents &quot;for the price of one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacGillis|first=Alec|last2=Kornblut|first2=Anne E.|title=Hillary Clinton Embraces Her Husband's Legacy|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/21/AR2007122102588.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|page=A1|date=2007-12-21|accessdate=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First term, 1993&amp;ndash;1997===
Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd [[President of the United States]] on January 20, 1993. In his inaugural address he declared:

{{cquote|Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal. There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/presiden/inaug/clinton1.htm|title=Bill Clinton First Address, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Legislative agenda====
Shortly after taking office, Clinton signed the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]], which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. While this action was popular, Clinton's attempt to fulfill another campaign promise of allowing openly [[homosexuality|homosexual men and women]] to serve in the armed forces garnered criticism from the left (for being too tentative in promoting [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]]) and from the right (who opposed any effort to allow gays to serve). After much debate, Congress implemented the &quot;[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]&quot; policy, stating as long as homosexuals keep their sexuality secret, they may serve in the military. Some gay rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n11_v28/ai_18855826 Stranger Among Friends. - book reviews] - John Cloud, ''[[Washington Monthly]]'', November 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaymilitary.ucsb.edu/PressClips/03_0110_WashingtonBladeEd.htm Washington Blade Editorial: Bush Has Mandate to Let Gays Serve] - Kevin Naff, Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military, [[2003-01-10]]&lt;/ref&gt; These advocates feel Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting President [[Harry Truman]] used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argue an executive order might have prompted the Democratic Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt; Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton said he did not think any serious person could say the way the policy was being implemented was not &quot;out of whack.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/1999/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/11/clinton.gays.military/index.html President seeks better implementation of 'do not ask, do not tell'] - [[CNN]], [[1999-12-11]] &lt;/ref&gt;

The Clinton administration launched the first official [[White House]] website on October 21, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |url=http://clinton1.nara.gov/White_House/html/White_House_Home.html |title=Welcome to the White House|work= |publisher= | date|accessdate=2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aa012201b.htm |title=The Clinton White House Web Site|work= |publisher= | date|accessdate=2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |url=http://clinton5.nara.gov/index.html|title=Welcome to the White House|work= |publisher= | date|accessdate=2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aa012201b.htm|title=The Clinton White House Web Site: Part 2: Preserving the Clinton White House Web Site|work= |publisher= | date|accessdate=2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, &quot;Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13011 – Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to fully utilize information technology to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Robert |last=Longley |url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aa012201a.htm|title=The Clinton White House Web Site: Part 1: Perhaps the most important Web site in American history|work= |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1993, Clinton controversially supported ratification of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] by the U.S. Senate. Clinton, along with most of his Democratic Leadership Committee allies, strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong intra-party disagreement. Opposition chiefly came from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of [[Ross Perot]]. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor, 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the President on January 1, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Livingston, C. Don, Kenneth A. Wink; &quot;The Passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the U.S. House of Representatives: Presidential Leadership or Presidential Luck?&quot; Presidential Studies Quarterly, Vol. 27, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton signed the [[Brady Bill]], which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases. He also expanded the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]], a subsidy for low income workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt;

One of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda was the result of a taskforce headed by [[Hillary Clinton]], which was [[Clinton health care plan|a health care reform plan]] aimed at achieving universal coverage via a national healthcare plan. Though initially well-received in political circles, it was ultimately doomed by well-organized opposition from conservatives, the [[American Medical Association]], and the health insurance industry. However, [[John F. Harris]], a biographer of Clinton's, states the program failed because of a lack of co-ordination within the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt; Despite his party holding a majority in Congress, the effort to create a national healthcare system ultimately died under heavy public pressure. It was the first major legislative defeat of Clinton's administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt;

Two months later, after two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress in the [[U.S. House election, 1994|mid-term elections in 1994]], for the first time in forty years.

Clinton signed the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]] in August 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for fifteen million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90% of small businesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/legacy/080393-presidential-press-conference-in-nevada.htm|title=Presidential Press Conference - 08/03/1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2% of taxpayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clintonpresidentialcenter.org/legacy/012594-speech-by-president-sotu-address.htm|title=1994 State of the Union Address}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, through the implementation of spending restraints, it mandated the budget be balanced over a number of years.

====Travelgate controversy====
{{main|White House travel office controversy|White House FBI files controversy}}

When several longtime employees of the White House Travel Office were fired, the White House travel office controversy began on May 19, 1993. A [[whistleblower]]'s letter, written during the previous administration, triggered an FBI investigation, which revealed evidence of financial malfeasance. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr investigated the firings and found no evidence of wrongdoing on the Clintons' part.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Kurtz, The Washington Post, [[1998-11-23]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose around improper access to [[FBI]] security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations. In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined that there was no credible evidence of any criminal activity. Ray's report further stated &quot;there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved&quot; in seeking the files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/07/28/clinton.filegate/|title=No substantial and credible evidence, CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Death penalty====
{{see|Capital punishment in Arkansas|Capital punishment by the United States federal government}}

The application of the federal death penalty was expanded to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise, by Clinton’s 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, &quot;''My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/102496-speech-by-president-to-the-people-of-new-orlean-la.htm|title=William J Clinton Foundation Speech by President to the People of New Orleans, LA, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While campaigning for U.S. President, then-Governor Clinton returned to Arkansas to see that [[Ricky Ray Rector]] would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but didn't understand the concept of death. According to Arkansas state and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the claim of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in a [[New York Times]] article as a possible political move to counter &quot;soft on crime&quot; accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Applebome|first=Peter|title=Arkansas Execution Raises Questions on Governor's Politics|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEED91F3EF936A15752C0A964958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=1992-01-25|accessdate=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;mbsrgd&quot;&gt;[[George Stephanopoulos]], ''All Too Human: A Political Education'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some sources Clinton was a death penalty opponent in his early years who switched positions.&lt;ref name = &quot;mbsrgd&quot;/&gt; During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty was re-enacted on March 23, 1973&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state/ Death Penalty Information Center]&lt;/ref&gt;). As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by [[electric chair]] and three by [[lethal injection]]. However, Clinton was the first President to pardon a death row inmate since the federal death penalty was reintroduced in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=126&amp;scid=13 Clemency&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Federal executions were resumed under his successor [[George W. Bush]].

===Second term, 1997&amp;ndash;2001===
[[Image:Clinton Karlspreis.jpg|thumb|250px|Clinton receiving the 2000 [[Charlemagne Prize]] for his work toward [[European integration]].]]

In the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]], Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2% of the popular vote over Republican [[Bob Dole]] (40.7% of the popular vote) and [[Reform Party USA|Reform]] candidate [[Ross Perot]] (8.4% of the popular vote), becoming the first Democrat to win presidential reelection since Franklin Roosevelt. The Republicans lost a few seats in the House and gained a few in the Senate, but overall retained control of the Congress. Clinton received 379, or over 70% of the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.

====Lewinsky scandal====
{{Main|Lewinsky scandal}}
The media and prominent Republicans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Time Line |work=Washington Post Special Report: Clinton Accused |date=September 13, 1998 |page=A32 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/timeline.htm | |publisher=The Washington Post | accesseddate =2007-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; raised controversy over Clinton's relationship with a 22-year-old White House intern named [[Monica Lewinsky]], resulting in the [[Lewinsky scandal]], on January 21, 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt; In a [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] session after the 1998 elections, for the belief Clinton lied about his relationship with Lewinsky in a sworn [[deposition]] in the [[Paula Jones]] lawsuit, the Republican-controlled House [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|voted to impeach Clinton]] in 1998, making him the second U.S. president to be impeached after [[Andrew Johnson]].

=====Impeachment and trial in the Senate=====
{{main|Impeachment of Bill Clinton}}
The House held no serious impeachment hearings before the [[U.S. midterm election|mid-term elections]]. Though the mid-term elections held in November 1998 were at the 6-year point in an 8-year presidency (a time in the electoral cycle where the party holding the White House usually loses Congressional seats) the Democratic Party gained several seats.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot;&gt;''The Survivor: Bill Clinton in the White House,'' John F. Harris , 2005, ISBN 0-375-50847-3&lt;/ref&gt; To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] session in December 1998.

While the [[House Judiciary Committee]] hearings were perfunctory and ended in a straight party line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely on the basis of Republican support but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]]. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony about his relationship to [[Monica Lewinsky]] during a sexual harassment lawsuit (later dismissed, appealed and settled for $850,000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/pjones/pjones.htm|title=Case Closed, Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought by former Arkansas state employee [[Paula Jones]]. The obstruction charge was based on his actions during the subsequent investigation of that testimony. The Senate later voted to acquit Clinton on both charges.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;CNN-Clinton_aquiter&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate refused to convene to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm [[Williams &amp; Connolly]].

The Senate concluded a twenty-one day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote on both counts falling short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an office holder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty. Some Republicans voted not guilty for both charges. On the perjury charge, fifty five senators voted to acquit, including ten Republicans, and forty five voted to convict; on the obstruction charge the Senate voted 50–50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton acquitted; president apologizes again |publisher=CNN |date=February 12, 1999 |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/12/impeachment/ |accessdate=2006-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Digital Millennium Copyright Act====
Clinton enacted the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] on October 21, 1998. It served as the first significant amendment to the [[United States Copyright Act|Copyright Act]] since 1976. The DMCA extended the protection of [[intellectual property]] to outlaw [[reverse engineering]] of digital protection. It provided a framework for [[record label|sound recording copyright owners]] and recording artists to seek public performance royalties under statute, which proved to be a landmark achievement for the recording industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Senate Ratifies Historic Treaties Securing Copyright Online |date=October 21, 1998 |url=http://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/press1998/102198.asp |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |accessdate=2007-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military and foreign events====
Three notable military events occurred during Clinton's second term. In Clinton's [[State of the Union Address]], Clinton warned Congress of Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein's]] pursuit of nuclear weapons:

{{cquote|Together we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons, and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them. Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, &quot;You cannot defy the will of the world,&quot; and when I say to him, &quot;You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Senate Ratifies Historic Treaties Securing Copyright Online |date=January 27, 1998 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/states/docs/sou98.htm|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

To weaken Saddam Hussein's grip of power, Clinton signed H.R. 4655 into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of &quot;regime change&quot; against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not speak to the use of American military forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.4655.ENR: Iraq Liberation Act of 1998], H.R.4655, One Hundred Fifth Congress of United States of America at Second Session; Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/libera.htm The Iraq Liberation Act, Statement by the President], Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release, October 31, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named [[Operation Desert Fox]], lasting from December 16 to December 19, 1998.

The [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] also occurred in [[Somalia]] in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. [[MH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopters were shot down by [[rocket-propelled grenade]] attacks to their [[tail rotor]]s, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets and broadcasted on television news programs. In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with less soldiers on the ground.

[[General Wesley Clark]] was [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe#Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR)|Supreme Allied Commander of NATO]] and oversaw the mission.

BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

After initial successes such as the [[Oslo accords]] of the early 1990s, Clinton attempted to address the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]]. Clinton brought Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]] and Palestinian Authority Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] together at [[Camp David]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt; However, the [[Camp David 2000 Summit|negotiations]] were ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt; The situation broke down completely with the start of the [[Second Intifada]].

Clinton became the first president to visit [[Vietnam]] since the end of the [[Vietnam War]]
in November 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1025169.stm Clinton's Vietnam Visit, [[BBC]] News 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton remained popular with the public throughout his two terms as President, ending his presidential career with a 65% approval rating, the highest end-of-term approval rating of any President since [[Dwight D.

Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Historical Budget Data |url=http://www.cbo.gov/budget/historical.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Congressional Budget Office |date=January 26, 2006 |accessdate=2007-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Whitewater controversy====
{{main|Whitewater (controversy)}}
The Whitewater controversy was an [[United States|American]] political controversy that began with the [[real estate]] dealings of Bill and [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Clinton]] and their associates, [[Jim McDougal|Jim]] and [[Susan McDougal]] in the [[Whitewater Development Corporation]], a failed business venture in the 1970s and 1980s.

[[David Hale (Whitewater)|David Hale]], the source of criminal allegations against President Bill Clinton in the Whitewater affair, claimed in November 1993 that Bill Clinton, while governor of Arkansas, pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the partner of the Clintons in the Whitewater land deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon031798&quot;&gt;[[Jonathan Broder]] and [[Murray Waas]], [http://www.salon.com/news/1998/03/cov_17news.html &quot;The road to Hale&quot;], [[Salon.com]], March 17, 1998. Accessed August 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] investigation did result in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains innocence in the affair.

====Law license suspension====
In a separate case, Clinton was ordered to pay $25,000 in fines to Arkansas state's bar officials and his Arkansas law license was suspended for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton to contest Supreme Court suspension |publisher=CNN |date=October 2, 2001 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/LAW/10/01/scotus.clinton/ |accessdate=2006-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement came on the condition that Whitewater prosecutors would not pursue federal [[perjury]] charges against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bill Clinton Disbarment to End |publisher=AP/11alive.com |date=January 18, 2006 |url=http://www.11alive.com/rss/article.aspx?storyid=74815 |accessdate=2006-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton was suspended by the Supreme Court in October 2001, and, facing disbarment from that court, Clinton resigned from the Supreme Court bar in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton asks to quit Supreme Court Bar |publisher=CNN.com |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/11/09/clinton.bar/ |date=November 9, 2001 |accessdate=2007-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Troopergate===
{{main|Troopergate (Bill Clinton)}}
Troopergate is the popular name of an alleged [[scandal]] involving allegations by two [[Arkansas]] state troopers that they arranged sexual liaisons for then-[[governor]] Bill Clinton. The allegations by state troopers [[Larry Patterson]] and Roger Perry were first reported by [[David Brock]] in the [[American Spectator]] in 1993. The story mentioned a woman named ''Paula'', a reference to [[Paula Jones]]. The troopers were discovered to have been paid for their stories and Brock later admitted journalistic dishonesty and apologized.

====Pardons and campaign finance====
{{main|Bill Clinton pardons controversy|1996 United States campaign finance controversy}}
Clinton issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20010120/aponline135239_000.htm &quot;Clinton Pardon's List&quot;], ''[[Associated Press]] via [[The Washington Post]]'', 2001-01-20&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the controversy surrounded [[Marc Rich]] and allegations that Hillary Clinton's brother, [[Hugh Rodham]], accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making regarding the pardons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton pardons: Cast of characters |publisher=BBC |date=February 22, 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1184118.stm |accessdate=2006-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Clinton's pardons remain a point of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Curl, Joseph, [http://washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070706/NATION/107060099/1001 &quot;Clintons hit over Libby criticism&quot;], ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) to influence the domestic policies of the United States, prior to and during the Clinton administration and also involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself.&lt;ref name=embassy&gt;Woodward, Bob and Duffy, Brian, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/People's Republic of China1.htm &quot;Chinese Embassy Role In Contributions Probed&quot;], ''Washington Post'', February 13, 1997

[[Image:Clinton approval rating.png|thumb|300px|Clinton's [[approval rating]]s throughout his presidential career]]

As he was leaving office, a CNN/USA TODAY/Gallup poll revealed only 45% said they'd miss him. While 55% thought he &quot;would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life&quot;, 68% thought he'd be remembered for his &quot;involvement in personal scandal&quot;, and 58% answered &quot;No&quot; to the question &quot;Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?&quot;. 47% of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters. 47% said he would be remembered as either &quot;outstanding&quot; or &quot;above average&quot; as a president while 22% said he would be remembered as &quot;below average&quot; or &quot;poor&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;CNN-Clinton-gone&quot;&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/10/cnn.poll.clinton/ Poll: Majority of Americans glad Clinton is leaving office] - Keating Holland, [[CNN]], [[2001-01-10]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gallup Organization]] published a poll in February 2007 asking respondents to name the greatest president in U.S. history; Clinton came in fourth place, capturing 13% of the vote. In a 2006 [[Quinnipiac University]] poll asking respondents to name the best president since [[World War II]], Clinton ranked 3% behind [[Ronald Reagan]] to place second with 25% of the vote. However, in the same poll, when respondents were asked to name the worst president since World War II, Clinton placed 1% behind Nixon and 18% behind George W.

As the first [[Baby Boomer]] president, Clinton was the first president in a half-century not to have been shaped by [[World War II]]. Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward state Clinton's innovative use of [[soundbite]]-ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning was major for his high public [[approval rating]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Walker, Clinton: the President they deserve, Fourth Estate 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Woodward, The choice: how Clinton won, Touchstone 1996, ISBN 0-684-81308-4&lt;/ref&gt; When Clinton played the saxophone on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', Clinton was sometimes described by religious conservatives as &quot;the [[MTV]] president.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bresler |first=Robert J. |title=The Muddled Meaning of the 2000 Election |publisher=USA Today (Society for the Advancement of Education)

Clinton was very popular among [[African American]]s and made improving race relations a major theme of his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&amp;amp;b=122950 A Conversation With President Bill Clinton on Race in America Today] - interview with Clinton, [[Center for American Progress]], July 16, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[Toni Morrison]] called Clinton &quot;the first Black president,&quot; saying, &quot;Clinton displays almost every trope of [[blackness]]: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, [[McDonald's]]-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas,&quot; and comparing Clinton's sex life, scrutinized despite his career accomplishments, to the stereotyping and [[double standards]] that blacks typically endure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrison |first=Toni |authorlink=Toni Morrison|coauthors= |title=Clinton as the first black president |work= |publisher=The New Yorker|month=October |year=1998|url=http://ontology.buffalo.edu./smith/clinton/morrison.html|format= |doi= |accessdate=2006-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, after having endorsed the candidacy of [[Barack Obama]], Morrison distanced herself from her 1998 remark about Clinton, saying that it was misunderstood. She noted that she has &quot;no idea what his real instincts are, in terms of race&quot; and claimed she was only describing the way he was being treated during the impeachment trial as an equivalent to a poor black person living in the ghetto.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, Andrea.

====Sexual misconduct allegations====
Throughout his career, Clinton has been subject to various allegations of sexual misconduct, though only his relationship with Lewinsky has been proven. Clinton categorically denies any inappropriate sexual conduct in all cases except the latter, though the Lewinsky affair and other allegations have become fodder for satirists, comedians, and parody in popular media.

He was transferred to [[Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center]] in New York City, where he underwent a successful quadruple [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] on September 6, 2004.

His aides, on the other hand, stewed over what they saw as her people’s disregard for the advice of one of this generation’s great political minds and bristled at surrendering control of his schedule. On the night of the [[Pennsylvania Democratic primary, 2008|Pennsylvania primary]], Clinton grew playfully competitive with his wife over who had done more events or had had more impact. Governor [[Ed Rendell]] showed Clinton the county-by-county returns, while she was superstitious and rarely watched election night coverage. According to Rendell, “The president wanted to know exactly what the returns were in the places he had been and Hillary hadn’t been. He kept showing Hillary, and she would laugh.”&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

Due to Clinton's prominent role in his wife's presidential run and his criticism of Obama, many perceived an enduring distance between the two. Clinton was asked later if he thought presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]] was qualified to be president. He replied that the Constitution sets qualifications. When pressed as to whether Obama was &quot;ready&quot; to be president, Clinton replied, &quot;You could argue that no one is ready to be president.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/151388/output/print|publisher=Newsweek|author=Jonathan Alter|accessdate=2008-08-28|title=A Catharsis in Denver?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama's election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008 when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 [[Democratic National Convention]], saying that all his experience as president assures him that Obama is &quot;ready to lead&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2008/08/bill_clinton_vouches_for_obama.html|title=Bill Clinton vouches for Obama: now &quot;ready to lead.&quot;|accessdate=2008-08-28|publisher=Sun-Times News Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfonso the Magnanimous''' (also '''Alphonso'''; [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: '''Alfons''') (1396 &amp;ndash; [[27 June]] [[1458]]) was the [[King of Aragon]] (as '''Alfonso V'''), [[King of Valencia|Valencia]] (as '''Alfonso III'''), [[Kingdom of Majorca|Majorca]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia and Corsica]] (as '''Alfonso II'''), and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Count of Barcelona]] (as '''Alfonso IV''') from 1416 and [[King of Naples]] (as '''Alfonso I''') from 1442 until his death. He was one of the most prominent figures of the early [[Renaissance]] and a knight of the [[Order of the Dragon]]. 

==Biography==
He was the son of [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]] (known as Ferdinand of Antequera) and [[Eleanor of Alburquerque]]. He represented the old line of the counts of [[Barcelona]] only through women, and was on his father's side descended from the [[House of Trastamara]], a noble family of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]]. By hereditary right he was king of [[Sicily]] and disputed the island of [[Sardinia]] with [[Genoa]]. Alfonso was also in possession of much of [[Corsica]] by the 1420s.

In 1421 Queen [[Joan II of Naples]], who had no children, adopted and named him as heir to the [[Kingdom of Naples]], and Alfonso went to [[Naples]]. Here he hired the famous [[condottiero]] [[Braccio da Montone]] with the task of reducing the resistance of the other pretender, [[Louis III of Anjou]], and his forces led by [[Muzio Attendolo]] [[Sforza]]. As Pope [[Martin V]] supported Sforza, Alfonso switched religious allegiance to the Aragonese [[antipope Benedict XIII]]. When Sforza also abandoned Louis, Alfonso seemed to have all his problems solved; however, his relationship with Joanna suddenly worsened, and in May 1423 he had her lover, and a powerful figure in the Neapolitan court, [[Gianni Caracciolo]], arrested. After an attempt to arrest the queen herself failed, Joanna called Sforza who defeated the Aragonese milices near [[Castel Capuano]] in Naples. Alfonso fled to Castel Nuovo, but the help of a fleet of 22 galleys led by [[Giovanni da Cardona]] improved his situation. Sforza and Joanna ransomed Caracciolo and retreated to the fortress of [[Aversa]]. Here she repudiated her earlier adoption of Alfonso and, with support from Martin V, named Louis III as her heir instead. The Milanese [[Filippo Maria Visconti]] joined the anti-Aragonese coalition. Alfonso requested support from Braccio da Montone, who was besieging Joanna's troops in [[L'Aquila]], but had to set sail for Spain, where a war had broken out between his brothers and the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. On his way towards Barcelona, he destroyed [[Marseille]], a possession of Louis III.

[[Image:King-alfonsoVaragon2.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Manuscript detail of Alfonso V of Aragon.]]

In the late 1423 the Genoese fleet of Visconti moved in the southern [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] and easily conquered [[Gaeta]], [[Procida]], [[Castellammare di Stabia|Castellammare]] and [[Sorrento]]. Naples, which was held by Alfonso's brother, Pedro, was besieged in 1424 by the Genoese ships and Joanna's troops, now led by [[Francesco Sforza]], son of Muzio (who had died at L'Aquila). The city fell in the April of that year. Pedro, after a short resistance in Castel Nuovo, fled to Sicily in August. Joanna II and Louis III again took possession of the realm, although the true power was in the hands of Gianni Caracciolo.

An opportunity for Alfonso to reconquer Naples occurred in 1432, when Caracciolo was killed in a conjure. Alfonso tried to regain the favour of the queen, but failed, and had to wait for the death of both Louis (at Cosenza in 1434) and Joanna herself (February 1435). In her will, she bequeathed her realm to [[René I of Naples|René of Anjou]], Louis III's brother. This solution was opposed by the new pope, [[Eugene IV]], who was nominal feudal lord of the King of Naples. As the Neapolitans had called for the French, Alfonso decided to intervene and, with the support of several barons of the kingdom, captured [[Capua]] and besieged the important sea fortress of Gaeta. His fleet of 25 galleys was met by the Genoese ships sent by Visconti, led by [[Biagio Assereto]]. In the [[Battle of Ponza (1435)|battle]] that ensued, Alfonso was defeated and taken prisoner.

In Milan, however, he impressed his captor with his cultured demeanor and persuaded him to let him go by making it plain that it was not in Milan's interest to prevent the victory of the Aragonese party in Naples. Helped by a Sicilian fleet, Alfonso recaptured Capua and set his base in Gaeta in the February of 1436. Papal troops had invaded the Neapolitan kingdom, but Alfonso corrupted the cardinal [[Giovanni Vitelleschi]], who commanded them, and his successes waned. 

{{Aragonese House of Trastámara}}

In the meantime, René had managed to reach Naples on [[may 19]], [[1438]]. Alfonso tried to besiege the city in the following September, but failed. His brother Pedro was killed during the battle. Castel Nuovo, where an Aragonese garrison resisted, fell to the Angevine mercenaries in the August of 1439. After the death of his condottiero [[Jacopo Caldora]], however, René's fortune started to wane: Alfonso could easily capture Aversa, [[Salerno]], [[Benevento]], [[Manfredonia]] and [[Bitonto]]. René, whose possession included now only part of the [[Abruzzi]] and Naples, obtained 10,000 men from the pope, but the cardinal leading them signed a truce with Alfonso. [[Giovanni Sforza]] came with a reduced corps, as troops sent by Eugene IV had halted his father Francesco in the [[Marche]]. 

Alfonso, who was provided with the most impressive artillery of the time, again besieged Naples. The siege began on [[November 10]], [[1441]], and ended on [[June 2]] of the following year.  After the return of René to Provence, Alfonso easily reduced the remaining resistance and made his triumphal entrance in Naples on [[February 26]], [[1443]], as the monarch of a pacified kingdom. In 1446 he conquered also Sardinia, becoming the head of the most important kingdom of western Europe. 

[[Image:Medalla de Alfonso V de Aragón (Pisanello, M.A.N. Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Alfonso V's silver medal ([[1449]]), by [[Pisanello]].]]

Alfonso had been betrothed to [[María de Castilla]] (1401&amp;ndash;1458; sister of [[Juan II of Castile]]) in [[Valladolid]] in 1408; the marriage was celebrated in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] during 1415. They failed to produce children.  Alfonso had been in love with a woman of noble family named [[Lucrezia d'Alagno]], who served as a ''de facto'' queen at the Neapolitan court as well as an inspiring [[muse]].

His Spanish possessions were ruled for him by his brother [[Juan II of Aragon|John]].  Alfonso, by formally submitting his reign to the Papacy, obtained the consent of Pope [[Eugene IV]] that the Kingdom of Naples would go to his immature son [[Ferdinand I of Naples|Ferdinand]]. He died in [[Castel dell'Ovo]] in 1458, while he was planning the conquest of Genoa. At the time, Alfonso was at odds with [[Pope Callixtus III|Callixtus III]], who died shortly thereafter.

Sicily and [[Sardinia]] were inherited by his brother John, who survived him.

He was also a powerful and consistent supporter of [[Scanderbeg]], whom he decided to take under his protection as a vassal in 1451, shortly after the latter had scored his second victory against Murad II. In addition to financial assistance, he supplied the [[Albania]]n leader with troops, military equipment, and sanctuary for himself and his family if such a need should arise.  This was because in 1448, while Scanderbeg was victoriously fighting off the Turkish invasions, three military columns, commanded by [[Demetrio Reres]] along with his sons Giorgio and Basilio, were dispatched to help Alfonso V defeat the barons of Naples who had rebelled against him.

==Art and administration==
[[Image:NapoliMaschioAngioinoIngresso.jpg|thumb|Castel Nuovo - triumphal arch entrance.]]
Like a true prince of the Renaissance he favoured men of letters whom he trusted to preserve his reputation to posterity.  He founded the Academy of [[Naples]] and, for his entrance in the city in 1443, had a magnificent triumphal arch added to the main gate of [[Castel Nuovo]]. This edifice, considered the most important civil piece of art of the time, was designed by [[Francesco Laurana]]. His devotion to the [[classics]] was exceptional even for the time. For example, Alfonso halted his army in pious respect before the birthplace of a Latin writer, carried Livy or Caesar on his campaigns with him, and his panegyrist [[Panormita]] even stated that the king was cured of an illness when a few pages of [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]]' history of [[Alexander the Great]] were read to him.  However, the classics had not refined his taste, for he was amused by setting itinerant scholars, who swarmed to his court, to abuse one another in the indescribably filthy Latin scolding matches which were then the fashion.  

After his conquest of Naples in 1442, Alfonso ruled by his mercenary soldiers and mercenary men of letters. In his Italian kingdom, he maintained the former political and administrative institutions; a unified General Chancellorship for the whole Aragonese reign was set in Naples, although the main functionaries were of Aragonese nationality. Apart from financial, administrative and artistical improvements, his other accomplishments in the Sicilian kingdom include the restoration of the aqueducts, the drainage of marshy areas, and the pavement of streets.

==Connection with Ethiopia==
Alfonso was the object of diplomatic contacts from the empire of [[Ethiopia]]. In 1428, he received a letter from [[Yeshaq I of Ethiopia]], borne by two dignitaries, which proposed an alliance against the [[Muslim]]s and would be sealed by a dual marriage that would require the Infante Don Pedro to bring a group of artisans to Ethiopia where he would marry Yeshaq's daughter. In return, Alfonso sent a party of 13 craftsmen, all of whom perished on the way to Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Girma Beshah and Merid Wolde Aregay, ''The Question of the Union of the Churches in Luso-Ethiopian Relations (1500-1632)'' (Lisbon:Junta de Investigações do Ultramar and Centro de Estudos Históricos Ultramarinos, 1964), pp.13-4.&lt;/ref&gt; He later sent a letter to Yeshaq's successor [[Zara Yaqob]] in 1450, in which he wrote that he would be happy to send artisans to Ethiopia if their safe arrival could be guaranteed, but it probably never reached the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Girma Beshah and Merid Wolde Aregay, ''The Question of the Union of the Churches'', pp.14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[O.

During [[World War II|the Second World War]], he served as [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Commander]] of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] in [[Europe]], with responsibility for planning and supervising the successful [[Battle of Normandy|invasion of France]] and [[Drive to the Siegfried Line|Germany]] in 1944–45. In 1951, he became the first [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe# Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR)|supreme commander of NATO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-23|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-2057/Dwight-D-Eisenhower|title=Dwight D. Eisenhower|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As President, he oversaw the cease-fire of the [[Korean War]], kept up the pressure on the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]], made [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|nuclear weapons]] a higher defense priority, launched the [[Space Race]], enlarged the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] program, and began the [[Interstate Highway System]].

The house in which he was born has been preserved as [[Eisenhower Birthplace State Historic Site]] and is operated by the [[Texas Historical Commission]].

He was named David Dwight and was called Dwight; he reversed the order of his given names when he entered [[United States Military Academy|West Point]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fpri.org/footnotes/129.200705.eisenhower.ww2meaningamericans.html |title=World War II and Its Meaning for Americans |accessdate=2008-09-06 |last=Eisenhower |first=David |authorlink=David Eisenhower |month=May |year=2007 |work=www.pfri.org |publisher=Foreign Policy Research Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is also where &quot;Ike&quot; received his nickname.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/marshall/meisen.htm Dwight D.

Eisenhower's paternal ancestors can be traced back to Hans Nicolas Eisenhauer, whose surname was German for &quot;iron worker.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://genealogy.about.com/library/surnames/e/bl_name-EISENHOWER.htm |title=EISENHOWER - Name Meaning &amp; Origin |accessdate=2008-09-06 |work=The New York Times Company|publisher=geneaology.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hans Eisenhauer and his family emigrated from [[Großrosseln|Karlsbrunn]] ([[Saarland]]), Germany to [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] in 1741.  Descendants made their way west. Eisenhower's family settled in [[Abilene, Kansas]] in 1892. His father David Eisenhower was a college-educated engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ambrose|1983|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenhower graduated from [[Abilene High School (Abilene, Kansas)|Abilene High School]] in 1909.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradyear&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,865992,00.html|title=Public School Products|accessdate=2008-09-06|date=1959-09-14|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

John, coincidentally, graduated from West Point on D-Day, June 6, 1944, and was married to Barbara Jean Thompson in a June wedding in 1947. John and Barbara had four children: Dwight David II, Barbara Ann, Susan Elaine and Mary Jean.  John's son, [[David Eisenhower|David]], after whom [[Camp David]] is named, married [[Richard Nixon]]'s daughter [[Julie Nixon Eisenhower|Julie]] in 1968.

===Religion===
Eisenhower's paternal ancestor, Hans Nicholas Eisenhauer, was probably of [[Lutheran]] or Reformed Protestant practice.{{fact|date=September 2008}}  Eisenhower's mother, Ida E. Eisenhower, previously a member of the [[River Brethren]] sect of the [[Mennonite]]s, joined the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society]] (now more commonly known as [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]) between 1895 and 1900, when Eisenhower was a child.&lt;ref name=SmithGS&gt;Smith, Gary Scott, (2006). - ''Faith and the Presidency: From George Washington to George W.

When Eisenhower joined the [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]], [[New York]] in 1911, his ties to Jehovah’s Witnesses were weakened because of the group's anti-[[militarism|militarist stance]].{{fact|date=September 2008}}  By 1915, his parents' home no longer served as the meeting hall.

===Education===
Dwight D. Eisenhower attended [[Abilene High School]] in Abilene, Kansas and graduated with the class of 1909.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradyear&quot;/&gt; He then took a job as a night foreman at the Belle Springs Creamery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-23|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,839998-3,00.html|title=Eisenhower: Soldier of Peace|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=[[1969-04-04]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletic career===
[[Image:Eisenhower Football.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the 1912 West Point football team. Cadet Eisenhower 2nd from left; Cadet [[Omar Bradley]] 2nd from right.]]
Eisenhower long had aspirations of playing [[professional baseball]].  He is quoted as saying:
:&quot;When I was a small boy in Kansas, a friend of mine and I went fishing and as we sat there in the warmth of the summer afternoon on a river bank, we talked about what we wanted to do when we grew up. I told him that I wanted to be a real major league baseball player, a genuine professional like [[Honus Wagner]]. My friend said that he'd like to be President of the United States. Neither of us got our wish.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;rayaip&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-23|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/prz_qde.shtml|title=President Dwight D. Eisenhower Baseball Related Quotations|publisher=Baseball Almanac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At West Point, Eisenhower tried out for the baseball team but did not make it.  He would later be quoted as saying that &quot;Not making the baseball team at West Point was one of the greatest disappointments of my life, maybe my greatest.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;rayaip&quot;/&gt;  But Eisenhower did make the football team.  He started as a varsity running back and linebacker in 1912.  In a bit of a fabled match-up, he even tackled the legendary [[Jim Thorpe]] in a 1912 game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-23|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/07/09/jim.thorpe/|title=Roller-coaster life of Indian icon, sports' first star |publisher=[[CNN]]|date=[[1912-07-15]]|author=Botelho, Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next week however, Eisenhower would hurt his knee after being tackled around the ankles, which he would soon worsen and permanently damage on horseback and in the boxing ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-23|url=http://www.eisenhowermemorial.org/stories/Ike-and-team.htm|title=Ike and the Team  |publisher=[[Dwight D.

[[Eisenhower Baseball Controversy|Controversy persists]] over whether Eisenhower played minor league (semi-professional) baseball for [[Junction City, Kansas|Junction City]] in the Central Kansas League the year before he attended West Point and played amateur football there.

In 1916, while stationed at [[Fort Sam Houston]], Eisenhower was football coach for St. Louis College, now [[St. Mary's University, Texas|St. Mary's University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ameddregiment.amedd.army.mil/fshmuse/tour8.htm |title=Eisenhower BOQ 1915 |accessdate=2008-05-24 |publisher=[[Fort Sam Houston]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ameddregiment.amedd.army.mil/fshmuse/eisen_football.htm |title=Lt Eisenhower and Football Team |accessdate=2008-05-24 |publisher=[[Fort Sam Houston]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early military career==
{{Refimprove|section|date=August 2008}}
{{see also|Military career of Dwight D. Eisenhower}}
Eisenhower enrolled at the United States Military Academy at West Point in June 1911. His parents were against militarism, but did not object to his entering West Point because they supported his education. Eisenhower was a strong athlete and enjoyed notable successes in his competitive endeavors. In 1912, a spectacular Eisenhower [[touchdown]] won praise from the sports reporter of the ''[[New York Herald]]'', and he even managed, with the help of a [[linebacker]] teammate, to tackle the legendary [[Jim Thorpe]]. In the very next week, however, his promising sports career ended when he incurred a severe knee injury.

[[Image:Dwight Eisenhower West Point.JPG|thumb|Memorial To Eisenhower at [[West Point]].]]

Eisenhower graduated in 1915. He served with the [[infantry]] until 1918 at various camps in [[Texas]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. During [[World War I]], Eisenhower became the #3 leader of the new tank corps and rose to temporary ([[Brevet|Bvt.]]) [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] in the [[National Army (USA)|National Army]]. He spent the war training tank crews in [[Pennsylvania]] and never saw combat. After the war, Eisenhower reverted to his regular rank of [[Captain (United States)|captain]] (and was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] a few days later) before assuming duties at [[Camp Meade]], [[Maryland]], where he remained until 1922. His interest in [[tank warfare]] was strengthened by many conversations with [[George S. Patton]] and other senior tank leaders; however their ideas on tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sixsmith|1973|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenhower became executive officer to General [[Fox Conner]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]], where he served until 1924. Under Conner's tutelage, he studied military history and theory (including [[Karl von Clausewitz]]'s ''[[On War]]''), and later cited Conner's enormous influence on his military thinking. In 1925–26, he attended the [[Command and General Staff College]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/bender/bender.asp |title=Watershed at Leavenworth |accessdate=2008-09-06 |last=Bender |first=Mark C. |year=1990 |publisher=U.S. Army Command and General Staff College }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then served as a [[battalion]] commander at [[Fort Benning]], Georgia until 1927.

[[Image:EisenhowersatMalecon.jpg|left|thumb|The Eisenhowers by the Malecón in [[Manila]], Philippines]]

During the late 1920s and early 1930s Eisenhower's career in the peacetime Army stagnated; many of his friends resigned for high paying business jobs. He was assigned to the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]], directed by General [[John J. Pershing]], then to the [[Army War College]], and then served as executive officer to General George V. Mosely, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to 1933. He then served as chief military aide to General [[Douglas MacArthur]], Army [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]], until 1935, when he accompanied MacArthur to the [[Philippines]], where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government. It is sometimes said that this assignment provided valuable preparation for handling the challenging personalities of [[Winston Churchill]], [[George S. Patton]] and [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Law Montgomery]] during World War II. Eisenhower was promoted to lieutenant colonel (in a non-brevet status) in 1936 after sixteen years as a major. He also learned to fly, although he was never rated as a military pilot. He made a solo flight over the Philippines in 1937.

Eisenhower returned to the U.S. in 1939 and held a series of staff positions in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[California]] and Texas. In June 1941, he was appointed Chief of Staff to General [[Walter Krueger]], Commander of the [[Third United States Army|3rd Army]], at [[Fort Sam Houston]] in [[San Antonio]], Texas. He was promoted to [[Brigadier General (United States)|brigadier general]] on October 3, 1941&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwightdeisenhower.com/general.html The Eisenhowers: The General]&lt;/ref&gt;. Although his administrative abilities had been noticed, on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II he had never held an active command and was far from being considered as a potential commander of major operations.

==World War II==
{{Refimprove|section|date=August 2008}}

After the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Eisenhower was assigned to the General Staff in Washington, where he served until June 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat Japan and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. He was appointed Deputy Chief in charge of Pacific Defenses under the Chief of War Plans Division, General [[Leonard T. Gerow]], and then succeeded Gerow as Chief of the War Plans Division. Then he was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff in charge of Operations Division under Chief of Staff General [[George C. Marshall]]. It was his close association with Marshall that finally brought Eisenhower to senior command positions. Marshall recognized his great organizational and administrative abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1942, Eisenhower was appointed Commanding General, [[European Theater of Operations]] (ETOUSA) and was based in [[London]]. In November, he was also appointed [[Supreme Commander Allied (Expeditionary) Force]] of the [[North African Theater of Operations]] (NATOUSA) through the new operational Headquarters [[AFHQ|A(E)FHQ]]. The word &quot;expeditionary&quot; was dropped soon after his appointment for security reasons. In February 1943, his authority was extended as commander of AFHQ across the Mediterranean basin to include the [[British 8th Army]], commanded by General Bernard Law Montgomery. The [[Eighth United States Army|8th Army]] had advanced across the [[Western Desert Campaign|Western Desert]] from the east and was ready for the start of the [[Tunisia Campaign]]. Eisenhower gained his fourth star and gave up command of ETOUSA to be commander of NATOUSA. After the capitulation of [[Axis Powers|Axis]] forces in [[North Africa]], Eisenhower remained in command of the renamed [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] (MTO), keeping the operational title and continued in command of NATOUSA redesignated MTOUSA. In this position he oversaw the [[Operation Husky|invasion of Sicily]] and the [[Allied invasion of Italy|invasion of the Italian mainland]].

[[Image:Eisenhower d-day.jpg|thumb|left|Eisenhower speaks with U.S. paratroopers of the [[502d Parachute Infantry Regiment]], [[101st Airborne Division]] on the evening of June 5, 1944.]]

In December 1943, it was announced that Eisenhower would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. In January 1944, he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF), serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945. In these positions he was charged with planning and carrying out the Allied [[Battle of Normandy|assault on the coast of Normandy]] in June 1944 under the code name [[Operation Overlord]], the liberation of western Europe and the invasion of Germany. A month after the Normandy [[D-Day]] landings on June 6, 1944, the [[Operation Dragoon|invasion of southern France]] took place, and control of the forces which took part in the southern invasion passed from the AFHQ to the SHAEF. From then until the [[The end of World War II in Europe|end of the War in Europe]] on May 8, 1945, Eisenhower through SHAEF had supreme command of all operational Allied forces&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|2]]&lt;/sup&gt;, and through his command of ETOUSA, administrative command of all U.S. forces, on the [[Western Front (WWII)#1944 – 1945|Western Front]] north of the [[Alps]].

As recognition of his senior position in the Allied command, on December 20, 1944, he was promoted to [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] equivalent to the rank of [[Field Marshal]] in most European armies. In this and the previous high commands he held, Eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy. Although he had never seen action himself, he won the respect of front-line commanders. He dealt skillfully with difficult subordinates such as [[Omar Bradley]] and [[George S. Patton|Patton]], and allies such as [[Winston Churchill]], Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] and General [[Charles de Gaulle]]. He had fundamental disagreements with Churchill and Montgomery over questions of strategy, but these rarely upset his relationships with them. He negotiated with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Georgy Zhukov|Marshal Zhukov]], and such was the confidence that President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had in him, he sometimes worked directly with [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], much to the chagrin of the British High Command who disliked being bypassed. During the advance towards Berlin, he was notified by General Bradley that Allied forces would suffer an estimated 100,000 casualties before taking the city. The Soviet Army sustained 80,000 casualties during the fighting in and around Berlin, the last large number of casualties suffered in the war against Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Este|2002|pp=694–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ambrose, Stephen E.|title=Eisenhower and Berlin, 1945: The Decision to Halt at the Elbe|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was never certain that [[Operation Overlord]] would succeed. The seriousness surrounding the entire decision, including the timing and the location of the Normandy invasion, might be summarized by a second shorter speech that Eisenhower wrote in advance, in case he needed it.  Long after the successful landings on D-Day and the [[BBC]] broadcast of Eisenhower's brief speech concerning them, the never-used second speech was found in a shirt pocket by an [[Aide-de-camp|aide]]. It read:

:Our landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. The troops, the air and the Navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.

==Aftermath of World War II==
=== Occupation of Germany ===
Eisenhower served as Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army from 1945–48. [[Image:68-527-8 USArmy.dtl.jpg|thumb|Eisenhower as General of the Army. Eisenhower was a heavy smoker.]] Following the German [[unconditional surrender]] on May 8, 1945, Eisenhower was appointed Military Governor of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|U.S. Occupation Zone]], based in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. Germany was divided into four Occupation Zones, one each for the U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Upon full discovery of the [[death camp]]s that were part of the [[Final Solution]] ([[the Holocaust|Holocaust]]), he ordered camera crews to comprehensively document evidence of the atrocity for use in the [[German war crimes#World War II|war crime]]s [[tribunal]]s. He made the decision to reclassify German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POWs) in U.S. custody as [[Disarmed Enemy Forces]] (DEFs), thus depriving them of the protection of the [[Geneva convention]]. As DEFs, their food rations could be lowered and they could be compelled to serve as [[unfree labor]] (see ''[[Eisenhower and German POWs]]''). Eisenhower was an early supporter of the [[Morgenthau Plan]] to permanently remove Germany's industrial capacity to wage future wars. In November 1945 he approved the distribution of 1000 free copies of [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Morgenthau]]'s book ''Germany is Our Problem'', which promoted and described the plan in detail, to American military officials in occupied Germany. Historian [[Stephen Ambrose]] draws the conclusion that, despite Eisenhower's later claims the act was not an endorsement of the Morgenthau plan, Eisenhower both approved of the plan and had previously given Morgenthau at least some of his ideas about how Germany should be treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ambrose, Stephen|title=Eisenhower: Soldier, General of the Army, President-Elect (1893–1952)|location=[[New York]]|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|date=1983|page=422}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also incorporated officials from Morgenthau's [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]] into the army of occupation. These were commonly called &quot;Morgenthau boys&quot; for their zeal in interpreting the occupation directive [[Morgenthau plan#JCS 1067|JCS 1067]], which had been heavily influenced by Morgenthau and his plan, as strictly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Petrov, Vladimir|title=Money and conquest; allied occupation currencies in World War II.|location=[[Baltimore]]|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|date=1967|pages=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Columbia University and NATO ===
In 1948, Eisenhower became President of [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Ambrose, ''Eisenhower'', New York, Touchstone Books, 1990, pp 234–235, ISBN 0-671-70107-X&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1950, he took leave from the university when he became the Supreme Commander of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), and given operational command of NATO forces in Europe. Eisenhower retired from active service on May 31, 1952, and resumed the university presidency, which he held until January 1953.

1948 also was the year that Eisenhower's memoir, ''[[Crusade in Europe]]'', was published.&lt;ref&gt;''Crusade in Europe'', Doubleday; 1st edition (1948), 559 pages, ISBN 1125300914&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded as one of the finest U.S. military memoirs.

=== Entry into politics ===
After his many wartime successes, Eisenhower was a great hero in the U.S. He was unusual for a military hero as he never saw the front line in his life. The nearest he came to being under enemy fire was in 1944 when a German fighter strafed the ground while he was inspecting troops in Normandy. Eisenhower dove for cover like everyone else and after the plane flew off, a British brigadier helped him up and seemed very relieved he was not hurt. When Eisenhower thanked him for his solicitude, the brigadier deflated him by explaining &quot;my concern was that you should not be injured in my sector.&quot; {{Fact|date=August 2008}}

Not long after his return in 1952, a &quot;[[Draft Eisenhower]]&quot; movement in the Republican party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential election]] to counter the candidacy of [[Non-interventionism|non-inteventionists]] Senator [[Robert Taft]]. (Eisenhower had been courted by both parties in 1948 and had declined to run then.) Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination but came to an agreement that Taft would stay out of foreign affairs while Eisenhower followed a conservative domestic policy. Eisenhower's campaign was a crusade against the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] administration's policies regarding &quot;[[Korea]], [[Communism]] and Corruption&quot; and was also noted for the simple but effective phrase &quot;I Like Ike.&quot; Eisenhower promised to go to Korea himself and end the war and maintain both a strong NATO abroad against Communism and a corruption-free frugal administration at home. He and his running mate [[Richard Nixon]], whose daughter later married Eisenhower's grandson David, defeated Democrats [[Adlai Stevenson]] and [[John Sparkman]] in a landslide, marking the first Republican return to the [[White House]] in 20 years. Eisenhower was the only general to serve as President in the 20th century, and the most recent President to have never held elected office prior to the Presidency. (The other Presidents not to have sought prior elected office were [[Zachary Taylor]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[William Taft]], and [[Herbert Hoover]].)

==Presidency 1953–1961==

Throughout his presidency, Eisenhower preached a doctrine of dynamic conservatism.  He continued all the major [[New Deal]] programs still in operation, especially [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]. He expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency, the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|Department of Health, Education and Welfare]], while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers. His cabinet, consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader, was dubbed by one journalist, &quot;Eight millionaires and a plumber.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900543-1,00.html |title=The Flavor of the New |accessdate=2008-05-28 |date=[[1969-01-24]] |publisher=Time }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenhower won his second term in 1956 with 457 of 531 votes in the [[Electoral College]], and 57.6% of the [[popular vote]].

===Interstate Highway System===
{{main|Interstate Highway System}}

One of Eisenhower's enduring achievements was championing and signing the bill that authorized the Interstate Highway System in 1956. He justified the project through the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] as essential to American security during the Cold War. It was believed that large cities would be targets in a possible future war, and the highways were designed to evacuate them and allow the military to move in.

Eisenhower's goal to create improved highways was influenced by his involvement in the U.S. Army's 1919 [[Transcontinental Motor Convoy]]. He was assigned as an observer for the mission, which involved sending a convoy of U.S. Army vehicles coast to coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-23|url=http://www.usswashington.com/dl30au39h1.htm|title=The Last Week - The Road to War|publisher=[[USS Washington (BB-56)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-23|url=http://usswashington.com/worldwar2plus55/index.htm|title=About the Author|publisher=[[USS Washington (BB-56)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His subsequent experience with German [[autobahn]]s during World War II convinced him of the benefits of an Interstate Highway System. Noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country, he thought an Interstate Highway System in the U.S. would not only be beneficial for military operations, but be the building block for continued economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-23|url=http://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/dl/InterstateHighways/InterstateHighwaysdocuments.html|title=“Interstate Highway System”|publisher=[[Eisenhower Presidential Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eisenhower Doctrine===
After the [[Suez Crisis]], the United States became the protector of most Western interests in the [[Middle East]]. As a result, Eisenhower proclaimed the &quot;[[Eisenhower Doctrine]]&quot; in January 1957. In relation to the Middle East, the U.S. would be &quot;prepared to use armed force...[to counter] aggression from any country controlled by international communism.&quot; On July 15, 1958, he sent just under 15,000 soldiers to Lebanon (a combined force of Army and Marine Corps) as part of ''[[Operation Blue Bat]]'', a non-combat peace keeping mission to stabilize the pro-Western government. They left the following October.

In addition, Eisenhower explored the option of supporting the French colonial forces in [[Vietnam]] who were fighting an independence insurrection there. However, Chief of Staff [[Matthew Ridgway]] dissuaded the President from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary.

===Civil rights===
Eisenhower supported the 1954 ''[[Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka]]'' U.S. Supreme Court decision, in which segregated (&quot;[[Plessy v. Ferguson|separate but equal]]&quot;) schools were ruled to be unconstitutional. The very next day he told District of Columbia officials to make Washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenhower|1963|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parmet|1972|pp=438–439}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed to Congress the Civil Rights Acts of [[Civil Rights Act of 1957|1957]] and [[Civil Rights Act of 1960|1960]] and signed those acts into law.  Although both Acts were weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation, they constituted the first significant civil rights acts since the 1870s.
The &quot;[[Little Rock Nine]]&quot; incident of 1957 involved the refusal by [[State of Arkansas|Arkansas]] to honor a Federal court order to integrate the schools. Under {{EO|10730}}, Eisenhower placed the [[Arkansas Army National Guard|Arkansas National Guard]] under Federal control and sent Army troops to escort nine black students into an all-white public school.  The integration did not occur without violence.  Eisenhower and Arkansas governor [[Orval Faubus]] engaged in tense arguments.

===Supreme Court appointments===
Eisenhower appointed the following [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justices]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]:

*[[Earl Warren]], 1953 (Chief Justice)
*[[John Marshall Harlan II]], 1954
*[[William J. Brennan]], 1956
*[[Charles Evans Whittaker]], 1957
*[[Potter Stewart]], 1958

===States admitted to the Union===
*[[Alaska]] – January 3, 1959 &lt;small&gt;49th state&lt;/small&gt;
*[[Hawaii]] – August 21, 1959 &lt;small&gt;50th state&lt;/small&gt;

==Post-presidency==

[[Image:Dwight D. Eisenhower, official Presidential portrait.jpg|thumb|Official White House portrait of Dwight D. Eisenhower.]]

In 1961, Eisenhower became the first U.S. president to be &quot;constitutionally forced&quot; from office, having served the maximum two terms allowed by the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]].  The amendment was ratified in 1951, during Harry S. Truman's term, but it stipulated that Truman would not be affected by the amendment.

Eisenhower was also the first outgoing President to come under the protection of the [[Former Presidents Act]] (two then living former Presidents, [[Herbert Hoover]] and [[Harry S. Truman]], left office before Act was passed). Under the act, Eisenhower was entitled to receive a lifetime pension, state-provided staff and a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-23|url=http://www.archives.gov/about/laws/former-presidents.html|title=Former Presidents Act|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1960 election to choose his successor, Eisenhower endorsed his own Vice President, Republican Richard Nixon against Democrat John F. Kennedy.  However, he only campaigned for Nixon in the campaign's final days and even did Nixon some harm.  When asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of Nixon's policy ideas he had adopted, he replied, &quot;If you give me a week, I might think of one.&quot;  Kennedy's campaign used the quote in one of its campaign commercials.  Nixon lost narrowly to Kennedy.

On January 17, 1961, Eisenhower gave his final televised Address to the Nation from the [[Oval Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-23|url=http://www.usa-presidents.info/speeches/eisenhower-farewell.html|title=Dwight D. Eisenhower Farewell Address|publisher=USA Presidents}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his farewell speech to the nation, Eisenhower raised the issue of the Cold War and role of the U.S. armed forces. He described the Cold War saying: &quot;We face a hostile ideology global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose and insidious in method...&quot; and warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals and continued with a warning that &quot;we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the [[military-industrial complex]]... Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.&quot;

Because of legal issues related to holding a military rank while in a civilian office, Eisenhower resigned his permanent commission as [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] before entering the office of President of the United States. Upon completion of his Presidential term, his commission on the retired list was reactivated and Eisenhower again was commissioned a five-star general in the United States Army.

===Retirement===
Eisenhower retired to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of their post-war time, a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]], [[Pennsylvania]]. In 1967, the Eisenhowers donated the farm to the [[National Park Service]] and since 1980 it has been open to the public as the [[Eisenhower National Historic Site]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/eise/ Eisenhower National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service)&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;. In retirement, he did not completely retreat from political life; he spoke at the [[1964 Republican National Convention]] and appeared with [[Barry Goldwater]] in a Republican campaign commercial from Gettysburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-23|url=http://livingroomcandidate.movingimage.us/election/index.php?nav_action=election&amp;nav_subaction=overview&amp;campaign_id=168|title=Johnson vs. Goldwater|publisher=The Living Room Candidate}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Eisenhower 67-475-19.jpg|thumb|Eisenhower leaving the White House after a visit with [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] in 1967]]

===Death and funeral===
Eisenhower died of [[congestive heart failure]] on March 28, 1969 at [[Walter Reed Army Hospital]] in Washington D.C. The following day his body was moved to the [[Washington National Cathedral]]'s Bethlehem Chapel where he lay in repose for twenty-eight hours. On March 30, his body was brought by [[caisson (military)|caisson]] to the [[United States Capitol]] where he lay in state in the [[Capitol Rotunda]]. On March 31, Eisenhower's body was returned to the [[Washington National Cathedral|National Cathedral]] where he was given an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] funeral service. That evening, Eisenhower's body was placed onto a train en route to [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]], [[Kansas]]. His body arrived on April 2, and was interred later that day in a small chapel on the grounds of the [[Eisenhower Presidential Library]]. Eisenhower is buried alongside his son Doud who died at age 3 in 1921, and his wife, Mamie, who died in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-23|url=http://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/quick_links/funeral/DDE_funeral.html|title=Dwight D. Eisenhower|publisher=[[Eisenhower Presidential Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
After Eisenhower left office, his reputation declined and he was seen as having been a &quot;do-nothing&quot; President. This was partly because of the contrast between Eisenhower and his young activist successor, [[John F. Kennedy]], but also because of his reluctance to support the [[civil rights]] movement to the degree that activists would have preferred, his handling of the [[1960 U-2 incident]], the Soviet Union's perceived leadership in the [[Arms race]] and the [[Space race]], and his failure publicly to oppose [[McCarthyism]], in particular his failure to defend [[George Marshall]] from attacks by [[Joseph McCarthy]], though he privately deplored McCarthy's tactics and claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-23|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/34_eisenhower/eisenhower_politics.html|title=Presidential Politics|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such omissions were held against him during the [[American liberalism|liberal]] climate of the 1960s and 1970s. Since that time, however, Eisenhower's reputation has risen.  In [[Historical rankings of U.S. Presidents|recent surveys]] of historians, Eisenhower often is ranked in the top 10 among all US Presidents.

==Tributes and memorials==
[[Image:Eisenhower bronze.jpg|thumb|The bronze statue of Eisenhower that stands in the [[United States Capitol rotunda|rotunda]]]]
Eisenhower's picture was on the [[Eisenhower Dollar|dollar coin]] from 1971 to 1978. Nearly 700&amp;nbsp;million of the copper-nickel clad coins were minted for general circulation, and far smaller numbers of uncirculated and [[proof coinage|proof]] issues (in both copper-nickel and 40% silver varieties) were produced for collectors. He reappeared on a [[United States commemorative coin|commemorative]] silver dollar issued in 1990, celebrating the 100th anniversary of his birth, which with a double image of him showed his two roles, as both a soldier and a statesman. As part of the [[Presidential $1 Coin Program]], Eisenhower will be featured on a gold-colored dollar coin in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usmint.gov/mint_programs/$1coin/index.cfm?action=schedule |title=Presidential Dollar Coin Release Schedule |accessdate=2008-05-24 |publisher=[[United States Mint]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 2002, the [[Old Executive Office Building]] was officially renamed the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. This building is part of the [[White House Complex]], west of the [[West Wing]]. It currently houses a number of executive offices, including ones for the Vice President and his or her spouse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/eeobtour/timeline.html The White House.

'''Colin Luther Powell''', [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath|KCB]] (Honorary), [[Meritorious Service Decoration|MSC]], 
(born [[April 5]], [[1937]]) is a retired General in the [[United States Army]]. He was the 65th [[United States Secretary of State]] (2001-2005), serving under [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]. He was the first [[African American]] appointed to that position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/637/The_first_African_American_secretary_of_state_Colin_Powell The first African American secretary of state, Colin Powell], The AfroAmerican Registry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/AfricanAm2003/powell.html Biographies - Colin Powell: United States Secretary of State], African American History Month, US Department of Defense&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9061121/Colin-Powell Colin Powell], Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2246150.stm Profile: Colin Powell], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[General (United States)|General]] in the [[United States Army]], Powell also served as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] (1987–1989) and as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] (1989–1993), holding the latter position during the [[Gulf War]]. He was the first and, so far, the only African American to serve on the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].
 
==Personal background==
Powell was born in [[Harlem]], a [[Neighbourhood|neighborhood]] in the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]] in 1937 to [[Jamaica]]n immigrant parents and was raised in the [[South Bronx]]. He also has Scottish, and other ancestries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wargs.com/political/powell.html&lt;/ref&gt; Powell attended [[Morris High School (New York)|Morris High School]], a former public school in [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]], from which he graduated in 1954. While in school, he worked a local shop where he picked up Yiddish from the shopkeepers and some of the customers. He remembers some of his Yiddish to this day. He gained a bachelor's degree in [[geology]] from [[City College of New York]] attaining a &quot;C&quot; average, according to his 2006 graduation address at [[Marymount University]]. He later obtained an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[The George Washington University]] after his second tour in [[Vietnam]] in 1971.

In 1962, he married Alma, who is now the co-chair of [[America's Promise]]. He is the father of [[Michael Powell (politician)|Michael Powell]], the former chair of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (Michael Powell was known mostly for a public battle with radio host [[Howard Stern]]).

Powell's first name is fairly common in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] but rare in the [[United States]]. He pronounces his name &quot;cole-in&quot;; most other men with this name pronounce it &quot;coll-in&quot; in the [[United Kingdom]]. In general, public officials and radio and television reporters have used Powell's preferred pronunciation.

==Military career==
While at [[City College of New York|City College]] Powell joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps and later described it as one of the happiest experiences of his life: finding something he loved and could do well, he had &quot;found himself.&quot; Cadet Powell joined the [[Pershing Rifles]], the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team started by GEN [[John Pershing]]. Even after Powell became a General, he still kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition. After graduating from City College in June 1958, he was granted a commission as an Army [[Second Lieutenant#United States|Second Lieutenant]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |title = Secretary of State Colin L. Powell (biography)|publisher = The White House|date = undated|url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/powell-bio.html|accessdate = 2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powell was a professional soldier for 35 years, during which time he held a variety of command and staff positions and rose to the rank of [[General officer|General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com|title=Colin Powell|publisher=Biography |accessdate=2007-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

While serving with the [[U.S. 3rd Armored Division|Third Armored Division]] in [[Germany]] as a Lieutenant, he met [[Elvis Presley]], then serving in that unit. During the [[Vietnam War]], Powell was a captain, serving as a South Vietnamese Army advisor from 1962 to 1963.  While on patrol in a Viet Cong-held area, he was wounded after stepping on a [[punji stake]] trap.&lt;ref&gt;Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), ''Jungle Snafus...And Remedies'', Oregon Institute of Science and Medecine (1996), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Vietnam as a major from 1968 to 1970, where he first served as the executive officer for the [[Americal Division]] (23rd Infantry Division), then as the assistant chief of staff of operations for the Americal Division.  In that post, he was charged with investigating a detailed letter by Tom Glen (a soldier from the [[11th Light Infantry Brigade]]), which backed up rumored allegations of the [[My Lai Massacre]]. Powell wrote: &quot;In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between Americal soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent.&quot; Later, Powell's assessment would be described as [[whitewash]]ing the news of the massacre, and questions would continue to remain undisclosed to the public. In May 2004 Powell said to [[Larry King]], &quot;I mean, I was in a unit that was responsible for My Lai. I got there after My Lai happened. So, in war, these sorts of horrible things happen every now and again, but they are still to be deplored.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell obtained an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[George Washington University]] in 1971 and then served a [[White House fellowship]] under President [[Richard Nixon]]. 

In his autobiography ''My American Journey'', Powell mentioned several officers he served under that inspired and mentored him.  As a [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] serving in [[South Korea]], for example, Powell was very close to General [[Henry &quot;Gunfighter&quot; Emerson]]. Powell said he regarded this man as one of the most caring officers he ever served under. Emerson reputedly had a somewhat eccentric personality. For example, he insisted his troops train only at night and made them repeatedly watch the television film ''[[Brian's Song]]'' to promote racial harmony. Powell always professed, however, that what set Emerson apart was his great love of his soldiers and concern for their welfare.

[[Image:GEN Colin Powell.JPG|thumb|250px|Official Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff portrait]]In the early 1980s, Powell served at [[Fort Carson, Colorado]]. It was there that he had a major clash with General [[John Hudachek]], his commander. Hudachek said in an efficiency evaluation that Powell was a poor leader who should not be promoted. Powell's rising military career was unhindered by Hudachek's evaluation report. After he left Fort Carson, Powell became senior military assistant to Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]], whom he assisted during the 1983 invasion of Grenada and the 1986 airstrike on Libya. 

In 1986, he took over the command of V Corps in Frankfurt Germany from Robert Lewis &quot;Sam&quot; Wetzel. In 1989, prior to being named Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Powell served as the Commander in Chief, Forces Command headquartered at [[Fort McPherson, Georgia]].

==Presidential appointments==
===National Security Advisor===
[[Image:ReaganPowell.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Ronald Reagan]] and National Security Advisor Powell in 1988]]
At the age of 49, Powell became [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], serving from 1987 to 1989. He retained his Army commission (he was a [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] at the time of his nomination) while serving as National Security Advisor. After his tenure with the NSC, Powell was promoted to 4-star [[General officer|General]] under President [[George H.W. Bush]] and served as Commander-in-Chief (CINC) of the [[United States Army]]'s [[Forces Command]] (FORSCOM), overseeing all Army, Army Reserve, and [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] units in the Continental U.S., [[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Puerto Rico]].

===Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff===
[[Image:DA-SD-05-00599.jpg|thumb|200px|right|General Colin Powell, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, waves from his motorcade during the Persian Gulf War, Welcome Home Parade, held in New York City, New York.]]

His last military assignment, from October 1, [[1989]] to [[September 30]], [[1993]], was as the 12th Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff#Chairman|Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the highest military position in the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. At age 52, he became the youngest officer, and first Afro-Caribbean American, to serve in this position. In 1989, he joined [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[Alexander Haig]] as the third general since World War II to reach four-star rank without ever being a divisional commander. Powell was also the first JCS Chair who was not a collegiate graduate of a [[United States Service academies|United States Service academy]], but rather, through [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]].&lt;ref name=noacad&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, he oversaw 28 crises, including the invasion of Panama in 1989 to remove General [[Manuel Noriega]] from power in the [[United States invasion of Panama]] and [[Operation Desert Storm]] in the 1991 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. During these events, Powell earned his nickname, &quot;the reluctant warrior&quot;. He rarely advocated military intervention as the first solution to an [[international dispute]], and instead usually prescribed [[diplomacy]] and [[containment]].

[[Image:Powell, Schwarzkopf, and Wolfowitz at Cheney press conference, February 1991.jpg|thumb|left|Powell (left) sits alongside [[Paul Wolfowitz]] (right) and [[Norman Schwarzkopf]] (middle) listening as Secretary of Defense [[Dick Cheney]] hosts a press conference during the Gulf War.]]

Powell mentioned in his autobiography that he is haunted by the nightmare of the Vietnam War. He felt the leadership was very ineffective. Powell served a tour in Vietnam as a military advisor, and was mildly injured when he stepped on a bamboo &quot;[[punji stick]].&quot; The large infection made it difficult for him to walk, and caused his foot to swell for a short time, shortening his first tour. It was also during his Vietnam service, his second tour, that Powell was decorated for bravery. He single-handedly rescued several men from a burning helicopter, one of them being Maj. Gen. [[Charles Gettys]], the commander of the [[Americal Division]].

Powell opposed the majority of George H.W. Bush Administration officials who advocated the deployment of troops to the [[Middle East]] to force [[Iraq]]i leader [[Saddam Hussein]] to withdraw his armies from neighboring [[Kuwait]], believing the dictator could instead be contained through [[International sanctions|sanctions]] and a buildup of forces around Kuwait.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

As an officer, Powell also valued [[loyalty]] very highly. As a military strategist, he has advocated an approach to military conflicts that maximizes the potential for success and minimizes casualties. A component of this approach is the use of overwhelming force, which he applied to Operation Desert Storm in 1991. His approach has been dubbed the &quot;[[Powell Doctrine]]&quot;.

Colin Powell's experience in military matters made him a very popular figure with both American political parties. Many [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] admired his moderate stance on military matters, while many [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past Republican administrations. Powell eventually declared himself a Republican, and began to campaign for Republican candidates. He was touted as a possible opponent of [[Bill Clinton]] in the [[1996 U.S. Presidential Election]], but Powell declined.

In 1997 Powell founded [[America's Promise]] with the objective of helping children from all socioeconomic sectors. Powell often wears the [[logotype|logo]] of the organization in the form of a red wagon pin on his lapel.

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. Presidential Election]] Powell campaigned for Texas Governor George W. Bush, serving as a key [[foreign policy]] advisor to the campaign. At the same time, it was often hinted that Powell might have been appointed to a position within a Democratic administration, should [[Al Gore]] have won.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Bush eventually won, and Colin Powell was appointed Secretary of State.

==Secretary of State==
[[Image:RicePowellBushRumsfeld.jpg|thumb|300px|Powell, National Security Advisor [[Condoleezza Rice]] and Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] listen to President [[George W. Bush]] speak.]]

As [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in the Bush administration, Powell was perceived as moderate. Powell's great asset was his tremendous popularity among the American people. Over the course of his tenure he traveled less than any other U.S. Secretary of State in 30 years. Powell was unanimously voted in by the United States Senate.

On [[September 11]], [[2001]], Powell was in [[Lima]], [[Peru]], meeting with President [[Alejandro Toledo]] and US Ambassador to Peru John Hamilton, and attending the special session of the [[General Assembly of the Organization of American States|OAS General Assembly]] that subsequently adopted the [[Inter-American Democratic Charter]].

After [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11]], Powell's job became of critical importance in managing America's relationships with foreign countries in order to secure a stable coalition in the [[War on Terrorism]].

In April 2002, he visited the site of the alleged [[Jenin Massacre]] in the [[West Bank]] and later said while testifying to Congress, &quot;I've seen no evidence that would suggest a massacre took place.&quot; Details of the events were unclear at the time, [[Shimon Peres]] was quoted by [[Ha'aretz]] speaking of a [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]] and IDF estimates of the dead were in the 100s. Later investigations by human rights organizations and the United Nations placed the number of deaths amongst Palestinians at 52.

Powell came under fire for his role in [[Rationale for the Iraq War|building the case]] for the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]]. In a press statement on [[February 24]], [[2001]] he had said that sanctions against Iraq had prevented the development of any weapons of mass destruction by [[Saddam Hussein]]. As was the case in the days leading up to the Persian Gulf War, Powell was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of Hussein, preferring to continue a policy of containment. However, Powell eventually agreed to go along with the Bush administration's determination to remove Hussein. He had often clashed with others in the administration, who were reportedly planning an Iraq invasion even before the September 11 attacks—an insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] in front of the [[9/11 Commission]]. The main concession Powell wanted before he would offer his full support for the Iraq War was the involvement of the international community in the invasion, as opposed to the unilateral approach some advocated. He was also successful in persuading Bush to take the case of Iraq to the United Nations, and in moderating other initiatives. Powell was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign.

[[Image:IraqMobileProductionFacilities.jpg|thumb|305px|Computer-generated image of an alleged [[Mobile weapons laboratory|mobile production facility for biological weapons]], presented by Colin Powell at the UN [[The UN Security Council and the Iraq war|Security Council]].

Powell's chief role was to [[The UN Security Council and the Iraq war|garner international support]] for a multi-national [[coalition]] to mount the invasion. To this end, Powell addressed a plenary session of the [[United Nations Security Council]] on [[February 5]], [[2003]] to argue in favor of military action. Citing &quot;numerous&quot; anonymous Iraqi defectors, Powell asserted that &quot;there can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

Most observers praised Powell's oratorical skills. However, Britain's Channel 4 News reported soon afterwards that a [[Iraq Dossier|UK intelligence dossier]] that Powell had referred to as a &quot;fine paper&quot; during his presentation had been based on old material and plagiarized an essay by an [[Ibrahim al-Marashi|American graduate student]].&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20030208115923/http://truthout.org/docs_02/020803A.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/07/sprj.irq.uk.dossier/index.html CNN.com - UK accused of lifting dossier text - Feb. 7, 2003&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  
A 2004 report by the [[Iraq Survey Group]] concluded that the evidence that Powell offered to support the allegation that the Iraqi government possessed [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs) was inaccurate. 

A Senate report on intelligence failures would later detail the intense debate that went on behind the scenes on what to include in Powell's speech. State Department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech. Some of the claims were taken out, but others were left in, such as claims based on the [[yellowcake forgery]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence. Reports have indicated that Powell himself was skeptical of the evidence presented to him. &lt;!-- anyone have a link? --&gt; Powell later recounted how Vice President Cheney had joked with him before he gave the speech, telling him, &quot;You've got high poll ratings; you can afford to lose a few points.&quot; Larry Wilkerson later characterized Cheney's view of Powell's mission as to &quot;go up there and sell it, and we'll have moved forward a peg or two.

In September 2005, Powell was asked about the speech during an interview with [[Barbara Walters]] and responded that it was a &quot;blot&quot; on his record. He went on to say, &quot;It will always be a part of my record. It was painful. It's painful now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Powell was seen as more moderate than most figures in the administration, he was spared many of the attacks that have been leveled at more controversial advocates of the invasion, such as [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and [[Paul Wolfowitz]]. At times, infighting between the Powell-led State Department, the Rumsfeld-led Defense Department, and Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]'s office had the effect of paralyzing the administration on crucial issues, such as what actions to take regarding Iran and North Korea.

After Saddam Hussein had been deposed, Powell's new role was to once again establish a working international coalition, this time to assist in the rebuilding of post-war Iraq. On [[September 13]], [[2004]], Powell testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledging that the sources who provided much of the information in his February 2003 UN presentation were &quot;wrong&quot; and that it was &quot;unlikely&quot; that any stockpiles of WMDs would be found. Claiming that he was unaware that some intelligence officials questioned the information prior to his presentation, Powell pushed for reform in the intelligence community, including the creation of a national intelligence director who would assure that &quot;what one person knew, everyone else knew&quot;.

Colin Powell announced his resignation as Secretary of State on Monday, [[November 15]], [[2004]]. According to the [[Washington Post]], he had been asked to resign by the president's chief of staff, [[Andrew Card]].&lt;ref name=DeYoung2006 /&gt; Powell announced that he would stay on until the end of Bush's first term or until his replacement's confirmation by Congress.  The following day, George W. Bush nominated National Security Advisor [[Condoleezza Rice]] as Powell's successor. News of Powell's leaving the Administration spurred mixed reactions from politicians around the world—some upset at the loss of a statesman seen as a moderating factor within the Bush administration, but others hoping for Powell's successor to wield more influence within the cabinet, and thus be a more credible negotiator.

In mid-November, Colin Powell stated that he had seen new evidence suggesting that [[Iran]] was adapting missiles for a nuclear delivery system.&lt;ref&gt;

On [[December 31]], [[2004]], Powell rang in the New Year by throwing the ball in [[Times Square]] with New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], ushering in the year 2005. He appeared on the networks that were broadcasting New Year's Eve specials and talked about this honor, as well as being a native of New York City.&lt;ref&gt;

==Life after diplomatic service==
After retiring from the role of Secretary of State, Powell returned to private life. In April 2005, he was privately telephoned by Republican senators [[Lincoln Chafee]] and [[Chuck Hagel]],&lt;ref&gt;VandeHei, Jim and Wright, Robin. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7420-2005Apr21.html &quot;Powell Playing Quiet Role in Bolton Battle&quot;], ''Washington Post'' ([[2005-04-22]]).&lt;/ref&gt; at which time Powell expressed reservations and mixed reviews about the nomination of [[John R. Bolton]] as ambassador to the [[United Nations]], but refrained from advising the senators to oppose Bolton (Powell had clashed with Bolton during Bush's first term).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was viewed as potentially dealing significant damage to Bolton's chances of confirmation. Bolton was put into the position via a [[recess appointment]] because of the strong opposition in the Senate.

On [[28 April]] [[2005]], an opinion piece in the ''[[The Guardian]]'' by [[Sidney Blumenthal]] (a former top aide to President [[Bill Clinton]]) claimed that Powell was in fact &quot;conducting a campaign&quot; against Bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together, which among other things had resulted in Powell cutting Bolton out of talks with Iran and Libya after complaints about Bolton's involvement from the British. Blumenthal added that &quot;The foreign relations committee has discovered that Bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to 10 intercepts by the [[National Security Agency]]. Staff members on the committee believe that Bolton was probably spying on Powell, his senior advisers and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic initiatives that Bolton opposed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

In July 2005, Powell joined [[Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers]], a well-known [[Silicon Valley]] [[venture capital]] firm, with the title of &quot;strategic limited partner&quot;.

In September 2005, Powell criticized the response to [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Powell said that thousands of people were not properly protected, but because they were poor rather than because they were black. 

On [[January 5]] [[2006]], he participated in a meeting at the [[White House]] of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss United States foreign policy with Bush administration officials. In September 2006, Powell sided with more moderate Senate Republicans in supporting more rights for detainees and opposing President Bush's terrorism bill. He backed Senators [[John Warner]], [[John McCain]] and [[Lindsey Graham]] in their statement that U.S. military and intelligence personnel in future wars will suffer for abuses committed in 2006 by the U.S. in the name of fighting [[terrorism]]. Powell stated that &quot;The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of [America's] fight against terrorism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

Also in 2006, Powell began appearing as a speaker at a series of motivational events called Get Motivated, along with former New York Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]]. In his speeches for the tour, he openly criticized the Bush Administration on a number of issues.  Powell has been the recipient of mild criticism for his role with Get Motivated which has been called a &quot;get-rich-quick-without-much-effort, feel-good schemology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americansatellite.org/2008/08/down-rabbit-hole.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

Most recently he joined the Board of Directors of [[Steve Case]]'s new company [[Revolution Health Group|Revolution Health]]. Powell also serves on the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] [[Board of directors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cfr.org/about/people/board_of_directors.html |title=Board of Directors-Council on Foreign Relations |accessdate=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell, in honor of Martin Luther King Day, dropped the ceremonial first puck at a [[New York Islanders]] game at [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum|Nassau Coliseum]].

Recently, Powell has encouraged young people to continue to use new technologies to their advantage in the future. In a speech at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] to a room of young professionals, he said, &quot;That’s your generation…a generation that is hard-wired digital, a generation that understands the power of the information revolution and how it is transforming the world. A generation that you represent, and you’re coming together to share; to debate; to decide; to connect with each other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;CSIS Launch of Next America, July 8th 2008&lt;/ref&gt; At this event, he encouraged the next generation to involve themselves politically on the upcoming Next America Project, which uses online debate to provide policy recommendations for the upcoming administration.

In 2008, Powell served as a spokesperson for [[National Mentoring Month]], a campaign held each January to recruit volunteer mentors for at-risk youth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/chc/wmy2008/Celebrities/colin_powell.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
A moderate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Powell is well known for his willingness to support [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] or [[centrist]] causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;issues&quot;&gt;[http://www.ontheissues.org/Colin_Powell.htm Colin Powell's biography from] [http://www.issues2000.org/default.htm 'On The Issues'].&lt;/ref&gt; He is [[pro-choice]] regarding [[abortion]], and in favor of &quot;reasonable&quot; [[gun control]].&lt;ref name=&quot;issues&quot;/&gt; He stated in his autobiography that he supports [[affirmative action]] that levels the playing field, without giving a leg up to undeserving person because of racial issues. Powell was also instrumental in the implementation of the military's [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]] policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;issues&quot;/&gt;

The Vietnam War had a profound effect on Powell's views of the proper use of military force. These views are described in detail in the autobiography ''My American Journey''. The [[Powell Doctrine]], as the views became known, was a central component of US policy in the [[Gulf War]] (the first U.S. war in Iraq) and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]] (the overthrow of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan following the events of &quot;9/11&quot;). The hallmark of both operations was strong international cooperation, and the use of overwhelming military force.

Powell was the subject of controversy in 2004 when, in a conversation with British [[Foreign Secretary]], [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], he reportedly referred to [[neoconservatives]] within the Bush administration as &quot;fucking crazies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being reported in the press (though generally, the expletive was censored in the U.S. press), the quote was used by [[James Naughtie]] in his book, ''The Accidental American: Tony Blair and the Presidency'', and by [[Chris Patten]] in his book, ''Cousins and Strangers: America, Britain, and Europe in a New Century''.

In a letter to Sen. [[John S. McCain III|John McCain]], General Powell expressed opposition to President Bush's push for [[military tribunals]] of those formerly and currently classified as [[enemy combatants]]. Specifically, he expressed concern of Bush's plan to &quot;amend the interpretation of Article III of the [[Geneva Conventions]].&quot; He also pointed out that perception of the [[War on Terror]] may be losing moral support saying, &quot;The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

*The Coat of Arms of Colin Powell was granted by the [[Lord Lyon]] in [[Edinburgh]] on [[February 4]], [[2004]]. Technically the grant was to Powell's father (a British subject) to be passed on by descent. [[Scotland]]'s [[King of Arms]] is traditionally responsible for granting arms to Commonwealth citizens.

The lion may be an allusion to Scotland. The shield can be shown surrounded by the insignia of an honorary Knight Commander of the Most honorable [[Order of the Bath]] (KCB), an award the General received after the first Gulf War.
*In 2005 Powell received the [[Bishop John T. Walker Distinguished Humanitarian Service Award]] for his contributions to [[Africa]].

'''Ivan Simon Cary Elwes''' (born [[October 26]], [[1962]]) is an [[England|English]] [[actor]] credited as '''Cary Elwes''', known for his performances in ''[[Another Country]]'', ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]'', ''[[Hot Shots!]]'', ''[[Glory (film)|Glory]]'', ''[[Liar, Liar]]'' and ''[[Saw (film)|Saw]]''.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Elwes was born in [[London]]. His advertising agent father [[Dominic Elwes]] and grandfather [[Simon Elwes]] were very well-known British portrait painters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/37/Cary-Elwes.html Cary Elwes Biography (1962-)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His father had moved in the circles of high society (and been friends with [[Richard Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan]] and [[Lady Annabel Goldsmith]] to whom he was also related) before he committed [[suicide]] in 1975. His mother, [[interior designer]] and shipping heiress [[Tessa Kennedy|Tessa Georgina Kennedy]], is of [[Croatian people|Croatian]] and [[Anglo-Irish]] descent;&lt;ref&gt;[http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/b/a/t/Robert-A-Battle/BOOK-0001/0000-0001.html Family Tree Maker's Genealogy Site: User Home Page Book: Cary Elwes: Title Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; she eloped with his father in 1958 at age nineteen to great [[scandal]]. Elwes's mother later re-married to [[Hollywood]] executive, [[Elliott Kastner]], from whom he has a half-sister, Milica Kastner and half-brother Dillon Kastner.

Elwes descends from a devoutly [[Roman Catholic]] [[Recusancy|recusant]] family on his father's side (originally known as the &quot;Cary-Elwes&quot; family, but now many branches of the family are now simply known as &quot;Elwes&quot;) which includes noted British [[monk]]s and [[bishop]]s, such as Abbott [[Columba Cary-Elwes]], Archbishop Dudley Cary-Elwes and Father Luke Cary-Elwes. He himself was an altar boy at the [[Brompton Oratory]]. He is also said to be distantly related to [[Guilford Dudley]], whom he played in the movie ''Lady Jane''. 

Elwes attended West Acre House at [[Harrow School]] in [[England]], and [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in [[Yonkers, New York]], where he studied, among other acting-related subjects, German Expressionist Film.

*His brothers are Cassian (1959) &amp; Damian (1960).

=== Career ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:CaryElwes.jpg|right|thumb|Elwes in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''|{{deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 2 October 2008}}]] --&gt;
Elwes made his acting debut in [[Mariek Kanievska]]'s famous film ''[[Another Country (play)|Another Country]] '' (where he played James Harcourt, a young and sentimental gay boy from an Eton-esque traditional English boarding School), with [[Rupert Everett]] and [[Colin Firth]].  His first notable role was [[Guilford Dudley]] in the highly acclaimed British epic ''[[Lady Jane (film)|Lady Jane]]'' after being personally chosen by distinguished Director of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], [[Trevor Nunn]]. After Elwes' success with this film, he turned down [[Trevor Nunn]]'s offer to join the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in order to continue work in movies. His performance in ''[[Lady Jane (film)|Lady Jane]]'' led Director [[Rob Reiner]] to cast him in another leading role, this time as the [[stable boy]] turned [[hero]] Westley in the American comedy ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', which required Elwes to do all of his own swordfighting and acrobatics. Elwes' breakthrough performance in ''The Princess Bride'' gained international acclaim and was his first major attempt at comedy. Prior to this film, he had no comedic experience, having only studied and worked in drama. 

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:LawrenceGordonSawShackled.JPG|left|thumb|Elwes in ''[[Saw (film)|Saw]]'']] --&gt;
Elwes continued working steadily, varying between dramatic roles, as in the [[Academy Award]]-winning ''[[Glory (film)|Glory]]'', and comedic roles, as in ''[[Hot Shots!]]''.  He starred as [[Robin Hood]] in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]'', parodying [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Kevin Costner]] in ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'', respectively.  (&quot;Unlike ''other'' Robin Hoods,&quot; he quips in the film, taking aim directly at [[Kevin Costner|Costner]] and [[Errol Flynn|Flynn]], &quot;''I'' can speak with an English accent!&quot;).  Elwes continued to appear in such popular movies as ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'', ''[[The Crush (1993 film)|The Crush]]'', ''[[The Jungle Book (1994 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'', ''[[Liar Liar]]'', ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'', ''[[The Cat's Meow]]'' and ''[[Kiss the Girls (film)|Kiss the Girls]]''. He did not appear in another [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] until 2004 in the [[Horror film|horror]]/[[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] ''[[Saw (film)|Saw]]''.  The same year he appeared in the film ''[[Ella Enchanted (film)|Ella Enchanted]]'', portraying the villain rather than the hero. In 2007, he made another &quot;bad guy&quot; appearance in ''[[Georgia Rule]]'', portraying a man discovered to be [[child molestation|molesting]] his stepdaughter.

Elwes has also appeared on television. In 1996, he played a bit part as &quot;David Libner&quot; on the hit show Seinfeld, opposite Debra Messing. In 1998, he played Astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] in the [[Golden Globe Award]]-winning [[HBO]] [[miniseries]] ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (TV series)|From the Earth To the Moon]].'' In 1999, he guest starred as Dr. John York in the Ripper episode of the television series ''[[The Outer Limits]]''. He earned two [[Satellite Awards|Golden Satellite Award]] nominations for his performances in the television films ''[[The Pentagon Wars]]'' and ''[[Uprising (film)|Uprising]]''. He had a recurring role in the final season (2001-2002) of ''[[The X-Files]]'' as [[FBI]] Assistant Director Brad Follmer. Chris Carter, creator of the X-Files, wrote the character especially for him.  In 2004, he received great praise with his portrayal of [[serial killer]] [[Ted Bundy]] in the [[A&amp;E Network]] film ''[[The Riverman]]'', which was based on the book ''The Riverman: Ted Bundy and I Hunt for the Green River Killer'' written by [[Robert D. Keppel]]. ''The Riverman'' became one of the highest rated original movies in the network’s history and garnered a prestigious BANFF Rockie Award nomination.  In 2005 he again received critical acclaim, internationally, with his portrayal of the young, pre-[[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] in the [[CBS]] [[made-for-TV movie]] epic ''[[Pope John Paul II (film)|Pope John Paul II]]''. This epic was highly successful not only in North America, but also in Europe, where it broke box office records in the late pope's native Poland and became the first film ever to break $1 million (GBP588,200) in three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His [[voice-over]] works include the narrator in [[James Patterson]]'s audio book ''The Jester''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = The Jester | work = ISBN 1-58621-535-3  | publisher = Hachette Audio, Abridged edition | date = [[1 March]][[2003]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
as well as characters in film and television animations such as ''[[Quest for Camelot]]'', ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', and the English versions of the Japanese films ''[[Porco Rosso]]'', ''[[Whisper of the Heart]]'', and ''[[The Cat Returns]]''. For the 2004 video game ''[[The Bard's Tale (2004)|The Bard's Tale]]'', he served as scriptwriter, improviser, and [[voice acting|voice actor]] of the main character The Bard.

He has also performed in the [[Bob Balaban]]-directed [[off-Broadway]] dramatic stage play ''[[The Exonerated]]'' in [[New York]] during the March 18-23, 2003 week run. 

In August 2005, he filed a lawsuit against his management firm and the producers of ''[[Saw (film)|Saw]]''. He alleged that he was promised &quot;a minimum of one percent of the producers' net profits&quot; and did not receive the full amount as promised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news 
 | title = Saw lawsuit

 | date = [[20 August]][[2005]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Elwes has volunteered as an actor with the [[Young storytellers program|Young Storytellers Program]]. 

He made an uncredited appearance as Lester Persky — the man who introduced [[Andy Warhol]] to [[Edie Sedgwick]] — in the 2006 film ''[[Factory Girl]]''. In 2007, he made a guest appearance on ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]''.

=== Personal life ===
Elwes and Lisa Marie Kurbikoff met in 1991 at a Malibu chili cook-off. He became engaged to Kurbikoff in  1997 in [[Paris]] and they wed in 2000. Elwes has two brothers, [[Cassian Elwes|Cassian]] and [[Damian Elwes|Damian]], and a half-sister [[Milica Kastner|Milica]], who are all involved in the entertainment industry. He has been active in fighting for the rights of Native Americans.

Lisa Marie Elwes gave birth to the couple's daughter, Dominique, born on [[April 24]], [[2007]] at 10:41 p.m. at [[Cedars Sinai Medical Center]] in [[Los Angeles]]. She weighed 7 lbs., 2 oz.&lt;ref&gt;http://people.aol.com/people/article/0,26334,1549247,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander (Aleksandr) II Nikolaevich''' ({{lang-ru|Александр II Николаевич}}) ([[Moscow]], 29 April 1818 – 13 March 1881 in [[St. Petersburg]]) was the [[List of Russian rulers|Emperor]] of the [[Russian Empire]] from 3 March 1855 until his [[assassination]] in 1881. He was also the [[Grand Duke of Finland]] and [[King of Poland]] until 1867 when it was annexed into the [[Russian Empire]].

==Early life==
Born in 1818, he was the eldest son of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] and [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Charlotte of Prussia]], daughter of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]]. His early life gave little indication of his ultimate potential; until the time of his accession in 1855, few imagined that he would be known to posterity as a leader able to implement the most challenging reforms undertaken in Russia since the reign of [[Peter the Great]]. 

In the period of over thirty-six years during which he was [[heir apparent]], the atmosphere of [[Saint Petersburg, Russia|St Petersburg]] was unfavourable to the development of any intellectual or political innovation. Government was based on principles under which all [[freedom of thought]] and all private initiative were, as far as possible, suppressed vigorously. Personal and official [[censorship]] was rife; criticism of the authorities was regarded as a serious offence. This was also regarded as one of the reasons which led to his assassination.

Under supervision of the liberal poet [[Vasily Zhukovsky]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=52BmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22alexander+II+of+Russia%22+zhukovski&amp;dq=%22alexander+II+of+Russia%22+zhukovski&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=iDXoSKCyPILoyAS9hZ2nAg&amp;pgis=1 ''The McGraw-Hill encyclopedia of world biography, vol. 1.''] McGraw-Hill, 1973. ISBN-13: 9780070796331; p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;, Alexander received the education commonly given to young Russians of good family at that time: a smattering of a great many subjects, and exposure to the chief modern [[Europe]]an [[European languages|languages]]. He took little personal interest in military affairs to the disappointment of his father, who was passionate about the [[military]]. Alexander gave evidence of a kind disposition and a warmheartedness which were considered out of place in one destined to become a military [[autocrat]].

==His reign==
Alexander II succeeded to the throne upon the death of his father in 1855. The first year of his reign was devoted to the prosecution of the [[Crimean War]], and after the fall of [[Sevastopol]] to negotiations for peace, led by his trusted counselor, [[Alexander Gorchakov|Prince Gorchakov]]. Then he began a period of radical reforms, encouraged by public opinion but carried out with autocratic power. All who had any pretensions to enlightenment declared loudly that the country had been exhausted and humiliated by the war, and that the only way of restoring it to its proper position in Europe was to develop its [[natural resource]]s and thoroughly to reform all branches of the administration. The government therefore found in the educated classes a new-born public spirit, anxious to assist it in any work of reform that it might think fit to undertake.
[[Image:Coronation of Tsar Alexander II -2.jpg|thumb|right|320px|&lt;center&gt;Painting by Mihály Zichy of the coronation of Tsar Alexander II and the [[Empress Maria Alexandrovna]], which took place on August 26/September 7, 1856 at the [[Cathedral of the Dormition|Dormition Cathedral]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]]. The painting depicts the moment of the coronation in which the Tsar crowns his Empress]] 

Fortunately for Russia the autocratic power was now in the hands of a man who was impressionable enough to be deeply influenced by the spirit of the time, and who had sufficient prudence and practicality to prevent his being carried away by the prevailing excitement into the dangerous region of [[Utopia]]n dreaming. Unlike some of his predecessors, he had no grand, original schemes of his own to impose by force on unwilling subjects, and no pet projects to lead his judgment astray. He looked instinctively with a suspicious, critical eye upon the panaceas which more imaginative and less cautious people recommended. These character traits, together with the peculiar circumstances in which he was placed, determined the part he would play in bringing to fruition the reform aspirations of the educated classes.

However, the growth of a [[Revolution|revolutionary movement]] to the &quot;left&quot; of the educated classes led to an abrupt end to Alexander's changes when he was assassinated by a bomb in 1881. It is interesting to note that after Alexander became tsar in 1855, he maintained a generally liberal course at the helm while providing a target for numerous assassination attempts (1866, 1873, 1880).

== Emancipation of the serfs ==
{{main|Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia}}
Though he carefully guarded his autocratic rights and privileges, and obstinately resisted all efforts to push him farther than he felt inclined to go, Alexander for several years acted somewhat like a constitutional sovereign of the continental type. Soon after the conclusion of peace, important changes were made in legislation concerning industry and commerce, and the new freedom thus afforded produced a large number of [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]]. Plans were formed for building a great network of [[railroad|railways]] &amp;mdash; partly for the purpose of developing the natural resources of the country, and partly for the purpose of increasing its power for defense and attack.

Then it was found that further progress was blocked by a formidable obstacle: the existence of [[serfdom]]. Alexander showed that, unlike his father, he meant to grapple boldly with this difficult and dangerous problem. Taking advantage of a petition presented by the [[Poland|Polish]] [[landed proprietor]]s of the [[Lithuania]]n provinces, and hoping that their relations with the serfs might be regulated in a more satisfactory way (meaning in a way more satisfactory for the proprietors), he authorized the formation of committees &quot;for ameliorating the condition of the peasants,&quot; and laid down the principles on which the amelioration was to be effected.
[[Image:Cartetsar.JPG|thumb|right|200px|&lt;center&gt;Tsar Alexander II and his wife, Empress Maria, with their son, the future [[Tsar Alexander III]]]]

This step was followed by one still more significant. Without consulting his ordinary advisers, Alexander ordered the Minister of the Interior to send a circular to the provincial governors of [[European Russia]], containing a copy of the instructions forwarded to the [[Governor-General|governor-general]] of Lithuania, praising the supposed generous, patriotic intentions of the Lithuanian landed proprietors, and suggesting that perhaps the landed proprietors of other provinces might express a similar desire. The hint was taken: in all provinces where serfdom existed, emancipation committees were formed.

The deliberations at once raised a host of important, thorny questions. The emancipation was not merely a humanitarian question capable of being solved instantaneously by imperial ''[[ukase]]''. It contained very complicated problems, deeply affecting the economic, social and political future of the nation.

Alexander had little of the special knowledge required for dealing successfully with such problems, and he had to restrict himself to choosing between the different measures recommended to him. The main point at issue was whether the serfs should become agricultural labourers dependent economically and administratively on the landlords, or whether they should be transformed into a class of independent communal proprietors. The emperor gave his support to the latter project, and the Russian peasantry became one of the last groups of peasants in Europe to shake off serfdom.

The architects of the emancipation manifesto were Alexander's brother [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Konstantin]], [[Yakov Rostovtsev]], and [[Nikolay Milyutin]]. On 3 March 1861, the sixth anniversary of his accession, the emancipation law was signed and published.

==Other reforms==
Other reforms followed: [[army]] and [[navy]] re-organization (1874); a new judicial administration based on the [[France|French]] model (1864); a new [[penal code]] and [[Judicial reform of Alexander II|a greatly simplified system of civil and criminal procedure]]; an elaborate scheme of local self-government ([[Zemstvo]]) for the rural districts (1864) and the large towns (1870), with elective assemblies possessing a restricted right of [[taxation]], and a new rural and municipal [[police]] under the direction of the [[MVD (Russia)|Minister of the Interior]]. Alexander II would be the second monarch (after King [[Louis I of Portugal]]) to abolish [[capital punishment]], a penalty which is still legal (although not practised) in [[Russia]].

However, the workers wanted better working conditions; national minorities wanted freedom. When radicals began to resort to the formation of [[Secret society|secret societies]] and to revolutionary agitation, Alexander II felt constrained to adopt severe repressive measures.

Alexander II resolved to try the effect of some moderate liberal reforms in an attempt to quell the revolutionary agitation, and for this purpose he instituted a [[ukase]] for creating special commissions, composed of high officials and private personages who should prepare reforms in various branches of the administration.

==Marriages and children==
{{wikisourcepar|Scribner's Monthly Magazine/Volume 3/Issue 2/The Imperial Family of Russia|an intimate glimpse into the family life of Alexander II (1871)}}

During his bachelor days, Alexander made a state visit to England in 1838. Just a year older than the young [[Queen Victoria]], Alexander took a liking to his distant cousin. The fondness however, was short-lived. While Victoria married her German cousin, [[Prince Albert]] in February 1840, Alexander became a husband the next year. On 16 April 1841 he married [[Marie of Hesse and by Rhine|Princess Marie of Hesse]] in St Petersburg, thereafter known as [[Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Maria Alexandrovna]]. The Tsarevitch claimed to be deeply in love with the young Princess and vowed to marry no one else. Marie was the legal daughter of [[Ludwig II, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine]] and [[Wilhelmina of Baden|Princess Wilhelmina of Baden]], although there was a question of whether the Grand Duke or her mother's lover, [[August von Senarclens de Grancy|Baron August von Senarclens de Grancy]], was her biological father. Alexander was aware of the question of her [[paternity]]. The marriage produced six sons and two daughters:

Alexander had many mistresses during his marriage and fathered 7 known illegitimate children. These included Antoinette Bayer (20 June 1856-24 January 1948) with his mistress Wilhelmine Bayer; Michael-Bogdan Oginski (10 October 1848-25 March 1909) with mistress Countess Olga Kalinovskya (1818-1854); and Joseph Raboxicz.

On 6 July 1880, less than a month after Tsarina Maria's death on 8 June, Alexander formed a [[morganatic marriage]] with his mistress Princess [[Catherine Dolgorukov]], with whom he already had four children. 
* George Alexandrovich Romanov Yurievsky (12 May 1872-13 September 1913). Married Countess Alexandra Zarnekau and had issue. They later divorced.

* Boris Alexandrovich Yurievsky (23 February 1876 - 11 April 1876).
* Catherine Alexandrovna Romanov Yurievsky (9 September 1878-22 December 1959). Married first Prince Alexander V. Bariatinsky and second Prince [[Serge Obolensky]], whom she later divorced.

==Suppression of national movements==
At the beginning of his reign, Alexander expressed the famous statement &quot;No dreams&quot; addressed for Poles, populating [[Congress Poland]], Western [[Ukraine]], [[Lithuania]], [[Livonia]] and [[Belarus]]. The result was the [[January Uprising]] of 1863-1864 that was suppressed after eighteen months of fighting. Thousands of Poles were executed, tens of thousands were deported to [[Siberia]]. The price for suppression was Russian support for Prussian-united Germany. Twenty years later, Germany became the major enemy of Russia on the continent.

All territories of the former [[Poland-Lithuania]] were excluded from liberal policies introduced by Alexander. The [[martial law]] in Lithuania, introduced in 1863, lasted for the next 50 years. Native languages, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] were completely banned from printed texts, see a , e.g., [[Ems Ukase]]. The [[Polish language]] was banned in both oral  and written form from all provinces except [[Congress Kingdom]], where it was allowed in private conversations only.

==Rewarding loyalty and encouraging Finnish nationalism==
[[Image:Alexander II (Romanov) monument in Helsinki, Finland.jpg|thumb|240px|&lt;center&gt;The monument to Alexander II &quot;The Liberator&quot; at the [[Helsinki Senate Square|Senate Square]] in Helsinki was erected in 1894. The date &quot;1863&quot; refers to the reopening of the [[Diet of Finland]]. This monument, expressing the Finns' gratitude to this Tsar, survived unharmed many later periods of tension and war with Russia under various of its later regimes.]]

In 1863 Alexander II re-established the [[Diet of Finland]] and initiated several reforms increasing Finland's autonomy from Russia including establishment of own [[currency]], the ''[[Markka]]''. Liberation of enterprise led to increased [[Foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] and industrial development. Finally, the elevation of [[Finnish language|Finnish]] from a language of the common people to a [[national language]] equal to [[Finland Swedish|Swedish]] opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as &quot;The Good Tsar&quot; in Finland.

Alexander's attitude towards Finland could be seen as genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in a small, homogeneous country than the whole of Russia. The benevolent treatment of Finland may also be seen as a reward for the loyalty of its relatively western oriented population during the [[Crimean war]] and during the [[January Uprising|Polish uprising]]. Encouraging Finnish [[nationalism]] and language can also be seen as an attempt to weaken the strong ties with Sweden.

==Assassination attempts==
In 1866 there was an attempt on his life in [[Petersburg]] by [[Dmitry Karakozov]]. To commemorate his narrow escape from death (which he referred to only as &quot;the event of April 4, 1866&quot;), a number of churches and chapels were built in many Russian cities.

On the morning of 20 April 1879, Alexander II was briskly walking towards the Square of the Guards Staff and faced [[Alexander Soloviev (Revolutionary)|Alexander Soloviev]], a 33 year-old former student. Having seen a menacing revolver in his hands, the Tsar fled. Soloviev fired five times but missed;and he was sentenced to death and hanged on 28 May.

The student acted on his own, but other revolutionaries were keen to murder Alexander. In December 1879, the [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]] (People's Will), a radical revolutionary group which hoped to ignite a [[social revolution]], organised an explosion on the railway from [[Livadia]] to [[Moscow]], but they missed the Tsar's train. On the evening of 5 February 1880 the same revolutionaries set off a charge under the dining room of the [[Winter Palace]], right in the resting room of the guards a story below. Being late for supper, the Tsar was unharmed, although 67 other people were killed or wounded. The dining room floor was also heavily damaged.

== Assassination ==
[[Image:AlexanderII of Russia(monument).jpg|thumb|220px|right|&lt;center&gt;The new [[Monument to Alexander II (Moscow)|monument to Alexander II]] in front of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in Moscow]]
After the last assassination attempt, [[Michael Tarielovich, Count Loris-Melikov|Count Loris-Melikov]] was appointed the head of the Supreme Executive Commission and given extraordinary powers to fight the revolutionaries. Loris-Melikov's proposals called for some form of parliamentary body, and the Emperor seemed to agree; these plans were never realized as on 13 March (1 March [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style Date]]), 1881 Alexander fell victim to an [[assassination]] plot.

As he had done every Sunday for a score of years, the tsar went to the Manege to review the Life Guards of the Reserve Infantry and the Life Guards of the Sapper Battalion regiments. He travelled both to and from the Menege in a closed carriage accompanied by six [[Cossacks]] with a seventh sitting on the coachman's left. The tsar's carriage was followed by two sleighs carrying, among others, the chief of police and the chief of the tsar's guards. The route, as always, was via the Catherine Canal and over the Pevchesky Bridge.

The street was flanked by narrow sidewalks on both the right and left side. A short young man wearing a heavy black overcoat edged towards the imperial carriage making its way down the street. He was carrying a small white package wrapped in a handkerchief. The youth was [[Nikolai Rysakov]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;After a moment's hesitation I threw the bomb. I sent it under the horses' hooves in the supposition that it would blow up under the carriage...The explosion knocked me into the fence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Radzinsky, Edvard, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'',(Freepress 2005) p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The explosion, while killing one of the Cossacks and seriously wounding the driver and people on the sidewalk, several critically, had only damaged the carriage. It was bulletproof, a gift from Napoleon III of France. The tsar emerged shaken but unhurt. Rysakov was captured almost immediately. Police Chief Dvorzhitsky heard Rysakov shout out to someone in the gathering crowd. Realizing there was another (if not more than one) bomber near by he urged the tsar to leave the area at once. Alexander agreed to do so but only after he had been shown the site of the explosion. Completely surrounded by the guards and the Cossacks, the tsar made his way over to the hole in the street. It was then that a young man, [[Ignacy Hryniewiecki]], standing by the canal fence, raised up both arms and threw something at the tsar's feet. Dvorzhitsky was later to write:
[[Image:Church of the Savior on Blood.jpg|thumb|220px|left|The [[Church of the Savior on Blood]] commemorates the spot where Tsar Alexander II was assassinated.]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;I was deafened by the new explosion, burned, wounded and thrown to the ground. Suddenly, amid the smoke and snowy fog, I heard His Majesty's weak voice cry, 'Help!' Gathering what strength I had, I jumped up and rushed to the tsar. His Majesty was half-lying, half-sitting, leaning on his right arm. Thinking he was merely wounded heavily, I tried to lift him but the tsar's legs were shattered, and the blood poured out of them. Twenty people, with wounds of varying degree, lay on the sidewalk and on the street. Some managed to stand, others to crawl, still others tried to get out from beneath bodies that had fallen on them. Through the snow, debris, and blood you could see fragments of clothing, epaulets, sabers, and bloody chunks of human flesh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.p.415&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later it was learned there was a third bomber in the crowd. [[Ivan Emelyanov]] stood ready, clutching a briefcase containing a bomb that would be used if the other two bombs, and bombers, failed.

Alexander was carried by sleigh to the Winter Palace, up the marble staircase, a trail of blood in his wake, and in to his study where, twenty years before almost to the date, he had signed the Emancipation Edict freeing the serfs. Alexander with both legs destroyed, was bleeding to death. Members of the Romanov family came rushing to the scene. One of them was the quiet, sensitive thirteen year old boy named Nicky, elder son of the [[Alexander III of Russia|heir-apparent Alexander]]; the boy would grow up to be tsar in his own right, [[Nicholas II of Russia]].

The dying tsar was given Communion and Extreme Unction. There was nothing to do now but wait. When asked how long it would be, the attending physician Dr. S.P. Borkin replied, &quot;Up to fifteen minutes&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ibid. 419&lt;/ref&gt;
At 3:30 that day the standard of Alexander II was lowered for the last time.

The assassination also caused a great setback for the reform movement. One of Alexander II's last ideas was to draft up plans for an elected parliament, or [[Duma]], which were completed the day before he died but not yet released to the Russian people. The first action Alexander III took after his coronation was to tear up those plans. A Duma would not come into fruition until 1905, by Alexander II's grandson, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], who commissioned the Duma following heavy pressure on the monarchy by the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]].

A second consequence of the assassination was anti-Jewish [[pogroms]] and [[May Laws|legislation]]. Despite the fact only one Jew was involved in the assassination conspiracy, over 200 Jews who had nothing to do with the murder of Alexander II were beaten to death in these pogroms.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

A third consequence of the assassination was that suppression of civil liberties in Russia and [[police brutality]] burst back with a full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II. Alexander II's murder and subsequent death was witnessed firsthand by his son, Alexander III, and his grandson, Nicholas II, both future Tsars, who vowed not to have the same fate befall them. Both used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people.

'''Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger''' ([[German language|German]] {{IPA2|ˌaɐnɔlt aloʏs ˈʃvaɐtsənɛɡɐ}}; born July 30, 1947) is an [[Austria]]n-American [[bodybuilder]], [[actor]], [[businessman]], and [[Politics of the United States|politician]], currently serving as the [[List of Governors of California|38th]] [[Governor of California|Governor]] of the state of [[California]].

Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a [[Hollywood]] action film icon. He was nicknamed &quot;The Austrian Oak&quot; and &quot;The [[Styria]]n Oak&quot; in his bodybuilding days, &quot;Arnold Strong&quot; and &quot;Arnie&quot; during his acting career, and more recently &quot;The Governator&quot; (a [[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of Governor and The [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]], one of his film roles).&lt;ref name=&quot;IMDb bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Biography for Arnold Schwarzenegger |publisher=IMDb |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216/bio |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he was first elected on October 7, 2003, in a special [[California recall election, 2003|recall election]] to replace then-Governor [[Gray Davis]]. Schwarzenegger was sworn in on November 17, 2003, to serve the remainder of Davis's term. Schwarzenegger was then re-elected on November 7, 2006, in [[California gubernatorial election, 2006|California's 2006 gubernatorial election]], to serve a full term as governor, defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Phil Angelides]], who was [[California State Treasurer]] at the time. Schwarzenegger was sworn in for a second term on January 5, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/05/AR2007010501386.html |title=Schwarzenegger Sworn in for Second Term |publisher=The Associated Press |accessdate=2008-04-23 |last=Kurtzman|first=Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2004 and 2007, he was named as one of the [[Time 100]] people who help shape the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Time Magazine: Time 100: Heroes &amp; Icons: Arnold Schwarzenegger |publisher=TIME |url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/2004/time100/heroes/100arnold.html |accessdate=2008-04-18 |last=Sullivan |first=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Leaders &amp; Revolutionaries: Arnold Schwarzenegger |publisher=TIME  |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/time100/article/0,28804,1595326_1615513_1615451,00.html |accessdate=2007-04-18 |last=Kennedy, Jr. |first=Robert F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger is married to [[Maria Shriver]] and has four children.

==Early life==
Schwarzenegger was born in [[Thal, Austria]] (German: ''Thal bei Graz''), a small village bordering the [[Styria]]n capital [[Graz]], and was [[christening|christened]] Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Time of His Life |url=http://schwarzenegger.com |work=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=2007-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were the local [[police chief]] [[Gustav Schwarzenegger]] (1907 – 1972), and his wife, Aurelia Jadrny (1922 – 1998). They were married on October 20, 1945{{ndash}} Gustav was 38, and Aurelia was a 23-year-old widow with a son named Meinhard. According to Schwarzenegger, both of his parents were very strict: &quot;Back then in Austria it was a very different world, if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot;/&gt; He grew up in a [[Roman Catholic]] family who attended church service every Sunday.&lt;ref name=&quot;tmas&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Andrews |first=Nigel |title=True Myths of Arnold Schwarzenegger |year=2003 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=1582344655}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Gustav had a preference for Meinhard, the elder of the two sons.&lt;ref name=&quot;governG2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Xan |last=Brooks |title=The Governator |date=2003-08-08 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2003/aug/08/usa.politicsandthearts |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2007-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His favoritism was &quot;strong and blatant,&quot; which stemmed from unfounded suspicion &quot;that Arnold wasn’t his child.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Leigh |first=Wendy |title=Arnold: An Unauthorized Biography |year=1990 |isbn=0720719976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger has said his father had &quot;no patience for listening or understanding your problems… there was a wall; a real wall.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tmas&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger had a good relationship with his mother, and kept in touch with her until her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger: Mr. Olympia{{ndash}} 1970-1975, 1980 |publisher=BodyBuild.com |url=http://www.bodybuildbid.com/articles/mrolympia/arnold-schwarzenegger.html |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later life, Schwarzenegger commissioned the [[Simon Wiesenthal Centre]] to research his father's wartime record, which came up with no evidence of atrocities.&lt;ref name=&quot;governG2&quot;/&gt; At school, Schwarzenegger was apparently in the middle, but stood out for his &quot;cheerful, good-humored and exuberant&quot; character.&lt;ref name=&quot;tmas&quot;/&gt; Money was a problem in the household; Schwarzenegger has recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot;/&gt;

As a boy, Schwarzenegger played many sports&amp;mdash;heavily influenced by his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;tmas&quot;/&gt; He picked up his first [[barbell]] in 1960, when his [[Association football|football]] coach took his team to a local gym.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; At the age of 14, Schwarzenegger chose [[bodybuilding]] over football (soccer) as a career.&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Katz |first=Ephraim |title=Film Encyclopedia |year=2006 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=0060742143}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile: Arnold Schwarzenegger |date=2004-08-31 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3131155.stm |work=BBC |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was age 13 when he started weightlifting: &quot;I actually started weight training when I was fifteen, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot;/&gt; However, his official website biography claims: &quot;At 14, he started an intensive training program with Kurt Marnul, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Mr. Everything |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/athlete/mreverything/index.asp?sec=athlete&amp;subsec=mreverything |work=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a speech in 2001, he said, &quot;My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;per&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Arnold |last=Schwarzenegger |title=ARNOLD'S &quot;PERSPECTIVES&quot; |date=2001-10-03 |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/life/hiswords/words_en_sac_perspectives.asp?sec=life&amp;subsec=hiswords |work=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as [[Reg Park]], [[Steve Reeves]], and [[Johnny Weissmuller]] on the big screen. &quot;I was inspired by individuals like Reg Park and Steve Reeves.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot;/&gt; When Reeves passed away in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: &quot;As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams ... Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Arnold |last=Schwarzenegger |title=In his own words |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/life/hiswords/life_hiswords_eng_legacy_366.asp?sec=life&amp;subsec=hiswords |work=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; He was so dedicated as a youngster that he was known to break into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. &quot;It would make me sick to miss a workout … I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot;/&gt; When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied, &quot;I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a [[John Wayne]] movie.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Ask Arnold |year=2000 |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/news/askarnold/news_askarnold_eng_legacy_444.asp?sec=news&amp;subsec=askarnold |work=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, his brother Meinhard died in a car accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; Meinhard had been drinking and was killed instantly, and Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot;/&gt; Meinhard was due to marry Erika Knapp, and the couple shared a three-year-old son Patrick. Schwarzenegger would pay for Patrick's education and a life in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot;/&gt; Gustav died the following year from a [[stroke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; In ''[[Pumping Iron]],'' Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his father's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest. Later, he and the film's producer both stated that this story was taken from another bodybuilder for the purpose of showing the extremes that some would go to for their sport, and to make Schwarzenegger's image more cold and machine-like to fan controversy for the film.&lt;ref&gt;Interview in ''Pumping Iron{{ndash}} 25th Anniversary Edition'' DVD extras&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, has said he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The girl who can't escape Arnie |date=2003-10-06 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/10/02/bfarni02.xml&amp;page=1 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he did not attend his father's funeral.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot;/&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what &quot;would now be called child abuse&quot; at the hands of his father. &quot;My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'you can't do this,' I said, 'this is not going to be for much longer, because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.' &quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnie: I was abused as a child |date=2004-08-04 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-312729/Arnie-I-abused-child.html |work=The Daily Mail |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnie: 'I was abused as child' |date=2004-08-04 |url=http://news.scotsman.com/arnoldschwarzenegger/Arnie-I-was-abused-as.2551492.jp |work=The Scotsman |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early adulthood===
Schwarzenegger served in the [[Military of Austria|Austrian army]] in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt; He won the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger went [[AWOL]] during basic training so that he could take part in the competition and spent a week in an army jail: &quot;Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences. When I got to Stuttgart, I was all confused. I forgot my posing routine, I had to borrow posing trunks, but still I won!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot;/&gt; Contrary to popular belief, it was not Schwarzenegger's bodybuilding debut, which had occurred two years earlier at a minor contest in Graz, at Steirer Hof Hotel (where he had placed second). He was voted best built man of [[Europe]], which made him famous.

&quot;The [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]] title was my ticket to America{{ndash}} the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;per&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the [[NABBA Mr. Universe]] competition in [[London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt; He would come in second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner [[Chester Yorton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt;

Charles &quot;Wag&quot; Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in [[Forest Gate]]. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training  program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the [[East End of London]] helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

Retrieved 2008-10-03. &quot;Wag and Dianne Bennett, an East End couple who gave Arnie a home for three years,&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The training paid off and in 1967 Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time in 1967, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at the age of 20.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt; He would go on to win the title a further four times.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger then flew back to [[Munich]], training for four to six hours daily, attending business school and working in a health club (Rolf Putzinger's gym where he worked and trained from 1966-1968), returning in 1968 to London to win his next Mr. Universe title.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt; He frequently told [[Roger C. Field]], a friend in Munich at that time &quot;I'm going to become the greatest actor!&quot;

===Move to the U.S.===
[[Image:Reagan+Schwarzenegger1984.jpg|thumb|right|Schwarzenegger with President [[Ronald Reagan]], 1984]]
Schwarzenegger moved to the United States in September 1968 at the age of 21, speaking little [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;/&gt; &quot;Naturally, when I came to this country, my accent was very bad, and my accent was also very strong, which was an obstacle as I began to pursue acting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot;/&gt; There he trained at [[Gold's Gym]] in [[Santa Monica]], California, under [[Joe Weider]]. From 1970 to 1974, one of Schwarzenegger's weight training partners was [[Ric Drasin]], a [[professional wrestler]] who designed the original Gold's Gym logo in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Randy (2003, October 21). [http://www.thearnoldfans.com/news/archives/2003/october/617.htm ''Ric Drasin: Arnold's lifting partner!''] The Farting Fans Website. Retrieved on April 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger also became good friends with professional wrestler [[Billy Graham (wrestler)|&quot;Superstar&quot; Billy Graham]]. In 1970, at age 23, he captured his first Mr. Olympia title in [[New York]], and would go on to win the title a total of seven times.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt;

In 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland Baker, an English teacher he lived with until 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;arniememoir&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnie's ex-girlfriend pens memoir |date=2003-09-09 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/3092740.stm |work=BBC |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger talked about Barbara in his [[memoir]] in 1977: &quot;Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;arniememoir&quot;/&gt; Baker has described Schwarzenegger as &quot;a joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic&quot; but claims towards the end of the relationship he became &quot;insufferable{{ndash}} classically conceited{{ndash}} the world revolved around him.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |title=Actor's old flame says he's a great guy |date=2003-09-15 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/09/15/MN272943.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=2007-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled ''Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Catherine |last=Elsworth |title=Arnie puts his weight behind ex-lover's tell-all memoir |date=2006-09-14 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1528857/Arnie-puts-his-weight-behind-ex-lover%27s-tell-all-memoir.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Baker, at times, paints an unflattering portrait of her former [[lover]]{{ndash}} Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakes&quot;/&gt; Baker claims, for example, that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakes&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakes&quot;/&gt; The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S.{{ndash}} their first date was watching the first [[Apollo Moon landing]] on television.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot;/&gt; They shared an [[apartment]] in [[Santa Monica]] for three and a half years, and having little money, would visit the beach all day, or have barbecues in the back yard.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot;/&gt; Although Baker claims that when she first met him, he had &quot;little understanding of polite society&quot; and she found him a turn-off, she says, &quot;He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be{{ndash}} he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive ... I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot;/&gt;

Schwarzenegger met his next love, Sue Moray, a [[Beverly Hills]] hairdresser's assistant, on [[Venice Beach]] in July 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot;/&gt; According to Moray, the couple led an open relationship: &quot;We were faithful when we were both in LA...but when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger met [[Maria Shriver]] at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977, and went on to have a relationship with both women until August 1978, when Moray (who knew of his relationship with Shriver) issued an ultimatum.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot;/&gt;

Schwarzenegger has said his big dream from the age of 10 was to move to the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAWarn&quot;&gt; {{cite news |first=Bill |last=Bradley |title=Mr. California |date=2002-11-20 |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2002-11-28/news/mr-california/ |work=LA Weekly |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He questioned what he was doing &quot;on the farm&quot; in Austria, and believed bodybuilding was his &quot;ticket to America&quot;: &quot;I’m sure I can go to America if I win Mr. Universe.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LAWarn&quot;/&gt; ''[[LA Weekly]]'' said in 2002 that Schwarzenegger is the most famous [[immigrant]] in America, who &quot;overcame a thick Austrian accent and transcended the unlikely background of bodybuilding to become the biggest movie star in the world in the 1990s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LAWarn&quot;/&gt;

{{seealso|Bodybuilding competitions featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger}}
Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding, and his legacy is commemorated in the [[Arnold Classic]] annual bodybuilding competition. Schwarzenegger has remained a prominent face in the bodybuilding sport long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows. For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines ''[[Muscle &amp; Fitness]]'' and ''[[Flex (magazine)|Flex]]''. Shortly after being elected Governor, he was appointed [[executive editor]] of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. The magazine ''MuscleMag International'' has a monthly two-page article on him, and refers to him as &quot;The King.&quot;

One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt; He would go on to compete in and win many bodybuilding contests, as well as some [[powerlifting]] contests, including five Mr. Universe (4{{ndash}} [[NABBA]] [England], 1{{ndash}} [[IFBB]] [USA]) wins, and seven [[Mr. Olympia]] wins, a record which would stand until [[Lee Haney]] won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.

===Strongman===
In 1967, Schwarzenegger competed in and won the Munich stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 [[German pounds]] (254 kg/560 lbs.) is lifted between the legs while standing on two foot rests. Schwarzenegger has said the following on his size: &quot;During the peak of my career, my calves were 20 inches, thighs 28.5 inches, waist 34 inches, chest 57 inches, and 22-inch arms.&quot;

In a full squat (buttocks close to ground) Schwarzenegger had a personal record of 181 kg/400lbs, for twelve repetitions.

===Mr. Olympia===
Schwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming [[Mr. Olympia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt; His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion [[Sergio Oliva]]. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he holds to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt;

He continued his winning streak in the 1971 – 1974 competitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt; In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time,&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt; beating [[Franco Columbu]]. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;/&gt;

Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called ''[[Pumping Iron]].'' Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' with [[Jeff Bridges]]. [[Lou Ferrigno]] proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia. After being declared Mr. Olympia for a sixth ''consecutive'' time, Schwarzenegger retired from competition.

Schwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger was training for his role in ''[[Conan the Barbarian (film)|Conan]]'', and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding, and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret, in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide [[color commentary]] for network television, when he announced at [[The Eleventh Hour|the eleventh hour]] that while he was there: &quot;Why not compete?&quot; Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. After being declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger officially retired from competition.

===Steroid use===
Schwarzenegger has admitted to using performance-enhancing [[anabolic steroid]]s while they were legal, writing in 1967 that &quot;steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when cutting up.&quot; He has called the drugs &quot;tissue building.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold Steroids&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold &amp; Steroids: Truth Revealed |publisher=get2net |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20031008172601/http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm |accessdate=2008-04-18 |last=Theunissen |first=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Dr. Willi Heepe, a German doctor who publicly predicted an early death for the bodybuilder, based on a link between steroid use and later heart problems. Because the doctor had never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]20,000 ($12,000 USD) [[libel]] judgment against him in a German court. In 1999, Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with ''[[The Globe (tabloid)|The Globe]]'', a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health. As late as 1996, a year before [[open heart surgery]] to replace an [[aortic valve]] with [[Aortic valve replacement|a human homograft valve]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/news/uptotheminute/news_uptotheminute_eng_legacy_18.asp?sec=news&amp;subsec=uptotheminute Renowned Cardiac Surgeon Proclaims Medical &quot;Facts&quot; In Article &quot;Represent No Facts At All&quot;] Schwarzenegger.com, (March 8, 2001).

Schwarzenegger was born with a [[bicuspid aortic valve]], an aortic valve with only two leaflets (a normal aortic valve has three leaflets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Surgery Leaves Star Undimmed |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NEWS+LITE+:+SURGERY+LEAVES+STAR+UNDIMMED-a083864140 |work=The Free Library |publisher=Farlex |date=[[1997-04-18]] |accessdate=2008-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both his father and his brother had the same condition.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

Schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the role of Hercules in 1970's ''[[Hercules in New York]]''. Credited under the name &quot;Arnold Strong,&quot; his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] after production.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;/&gt; His second film appearance was as a [[deaf]] and [[speech disorder|mute]] hit-man for the mob in director [[Robert Altman|Robert Altman's]] ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' (1976), for which he was awarded a [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year - Actor|Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year]]. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career. &quot;It was very difficult for me in the beginning{{ndash}} I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird,' that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot;/&gt;

Schwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the [[bodybuilding]] film ''[[Pumping Iron]]'' (1977),&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot;/&gt; elements of which were dramatized. In 1991, Schwarzenegger purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |title=The Smoking Gun: Archive |publisher=TheSmokingGun |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/arnoldpump1.html |accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', but did not win the role due to his height. Later, [[Lou Ferrigno]] got the part of Dr. David Banner's alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Ann-Margret]] in the 1979 comedy ''[[The Villain (1979 film)|The Villain]]''.

Schwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the mythical epic ''[[Conan the Barbarian (film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' in 1982, which was a box-office hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot;/&gt; This was followed by a sequel, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' in 1984, although its performance was disappointing.&lt;ref name=&quot;tessay&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Clark |last=Collis |title=EMPIRE ESSAY: The Terminator |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |work=Empire magazine |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video &quot;[[Rio Carnival|Carnival in Rio]]&quot;.

[[Image:Terminator.jpg|185px|thumb|left|Poster for ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984), featuring Schwarzenegger.]]

In 1984, he made the first of three appearances as the titular character in director [[James Cameron]]'s [[science-fiction]] film ''[[The Terminator]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fanleam&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Leamer |first=Laurence |title=Fantastic: The life of Arnold Schwarzenegger |year=2005 |publisher=St Martin’s Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following ''The Terminator'', Schwarzenegger made ''[[Red Sonja (film)|Red Sonja]]'' in 1985, which &quot;sank without a trace.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tessay&quot;/&gt;

During the 1980s, audiences had a large appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and [[Sylvester Stallone]] becoming international stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his droll, often self-deprecating sense of humor (including sometimes famously bad [[pun]]s), separating his roles from more serious action hero fare. His alternative-universe comedy/thriller ''[[Last Action Hero]]'' featured a poster of the movie ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' which, in the fictional alternate universe, had [[Sylvester Stallone]] as its star.

Following his arrival as a Hollywood superstar, he made a number of successful films: ''[[Commando (film)|Commando]]'' (1985), ''[[Raw Deal (1986 movie)|Raw Deal]]'' (1986), ''[[The Running Man (film)|The Running Man]]'' (1987), and ''[[Red Heat]]'' (1988). In ''[[Predator (movie)|Predator]]'' (1987), another successful film, Schwarzenegger led a cast which included future [[Minnesota]] [[List of Governors of Minnesota|Governor]] [[Jesse Ventura]] (Ventura also appeared in ''[[The Running Man (film)|The Running Man]]'' and ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'' with Schwarzenegger) and future [[Kentucky]] [[Governor of Kentucky|Gubernatorial]] candidate [[Sonny Landham]].

''[[Twins (movie)|Twins]]'' (1988), a comedy with [[Danny DeVito]], was a change of pace, and also proved successful. ''[[Total Recall (film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10 million and 15% of the gross, and was a widely praised, science-fiction script directed by Paul Verhoeven, based on the [[Philip K. Dick]] short story, &quot;[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]&quot;. ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990) reunited him with director [[Ivan Reitman]], who directed him in ''Twins''.

Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing, first with a 1990 episode of the [[TV series]] ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', entitled &quot;[[List of Tales from the Crypt episodes#Season 2 (1990)|The Switch]],&quot; and then with the 1992 [[telemovie]] ''[[Christmas in Connecticut]]''. He has not directed since.

Schwarzenegger's commercial high-water mark was the 1991 sequel to his 1984 hit ''The Terminator'': ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', which was one of the highest-grossing films of the year. In 1993, the [[National Association of Theatre Owners]] named him the &quot;International Star of the Decade.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; His next film project, the 1993 self-aware [[action comedy]] [[spoof]] ''[[Last Action Hero]]'' was released opposite ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', with the box office  suffering accordingly. His next film, the action comedy ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994) was a highly popular send-up of spy films, and saw Schwarzenegger, reunited with ''The Terminator'' director [[James Cameron]], appearing opposite [[Jamie Lee Curtis]].

[[Image:Ourgovernor.jpg‎|thumb|215px|right|Schwarzenegger as [[Mr. Freeze]] in the 1997 ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'' film.]]
Shortly thereafter came the comedy ''[[Junior (film)|Junior]]'' (1994), directed by ''Twins'' director Ivan Reitman and again playing opposite co-star [[Danny DeVito]]. This film brought Schwarzenegger his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor{{ndash}} Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy]]. It was followed by the action thriller ''[[Eraser (movie)|Eraser]]'' (1996), and the [[comic book]]-based ''[[Batman &amp; Robin]]'' (1997), where he played the villain [[Mr. Freeze]]. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the failure of ''Batman &amp; Robin'', Schwarzenegger's film career and box office prominence went into decline.

Several film projects were announced with Schwarzenegger attached to star, including the remake of ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', a new film version of ''[[I Am Legend]]'', and a [[World War II]] film scripted by [[Quentin Tarantino]] that would have seen Schwarzenegger play an Austrian.

Instead, he returned after a hiatus with the supernatural thriller ''[[End of Days (film)|''End of Days'']]'' (1999), later followed by the action films ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000) and ''[[Collateral Damage (film)|Collateral Damage]]'' (2002). In 2003, he reprised his role in ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'', which went on to earn over $150 million domestically.

In tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a 25-meter (82-foot) tall ''Terminator'' statue in a park in central Graz. Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the [[Special Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold wants 'Terminator' statue killed |publisher=Killoggs |url=http://www.killoggs.com/news/?news=609 |date=2002-09-27 |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His latest film appearances included a 3-second cameo appearance in ''[[The Rundown]]'' (AKA, ''Welcome to the Jungle'') with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], and the 2004 remake of ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 movie)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'', where he appeared onscreen with action star [[Jackie Chan]] for the first time.

Schwarzenegger voiced [[Baron von Steuben]] in Episode 24 (&quot;[[Valley Forge]]&quot;) of ''[[Liberty's Kids]]''.

==Political career==
{{main|Political career of Arnold Schwarzenegger}}
[[Image:Arnold-Cheney.jpg|thumb|right|Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] meets with Schwarzenegger for the first time at the [[White House]]]]

===Early politics===
Schwarzenegger has been a registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for many years. As an actor, his political views were always well-known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars, who are generally considered to be a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-leaning community. At the [[2004 Republican National Convention]], Schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained why he was a Republican:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/31/gop.schwarzenegger.transcript/ |date=August 31, 2004 |title=Schwarzenegger: No country more welcoming than the USA |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|I finally arrived here in 1968. What a special day it was. I remember I arrived here with empty pockets but full of dreams, full of determination, full of desire. The [[United States presidential election, 1968|presidential campaign]] was in full swing. I remember watching the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]-[[Hubert Humphrey|Humphrey]] presidential race on TV. A friend of mine who spoke German and English translated for me. I heard Humphrey saying things that sounded like [[socialism]], which I had just left.

But then I heard Nixon speak. He was talking about free enterprise, getting the government off your back, lowering the taxes and strengthening the military. Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air. I said to my friend, I said, &quot;What party is he?&quot; My friend said, &quot;He's a Republican.&quot; I said, &quot;Then I am a Republican.&quot; And I have been a Republican ever since.}}

In 1985, Schwarzenegger appeared in ''[[Stop the Madness]]'', an anti-[[Illegal drug trade|drug]] music video sponsored by the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]. He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 Presidential election]], accompanying then-[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George H.W. Bush]] at a campaign rally.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

Schwarzenegger's first political appointment was as chairman of the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]], on which he served from 1990 to 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; He was nominated by George H. W. Bush, who dubbed him &quot;[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Republican&quot;. He later served as Chairman for the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor [[Pete Wilson]]. Yet, political analysts have identified Schwarzenegger as a liberal, as he has become more left-leaning since his election.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usliberals.about.com/b/2006/01/14/arnold-schwarzenegger-californias-newest-democrat.htm |title=''Arnold Schwarzenegger, California's Newest Democrat'' |accessdate=2008-04-18 |last=White |first=Deborah |date=2006-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1993 and 1994, Schwarzenegger was a Red Cross ambassador (a mostly ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television/radio [[public service announcement]]s to give blood. A small amount of interest was garnered by his wearing of a white t-shirt with the Red Cross on it, while posing with a flexed arm; the image made it into several celebrity magazines.

In an interview with ''[[Talk (magazine)|Talk]]'' magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied, &quot;I think about it many times. The possibility is there, because I feel it inside.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;governtalk&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnold cast as Governor? |date=1999-10-04 |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/news.asp?id=90 |work=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for [[governor of California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;governtalk&quot;/&gt; Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, &quot;I'm in show business{{ndash}} I am in the middle of my career. Why would I go away from that and jump into something else?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;governtalk&quot;/&gt;

===Governor of California===
[[Image:Schwarzenegger Bush.jpg|thumb|left|President [[George W. Bush]] meets with Schwarzenegger after his successful election to the California Governorship]]
{{seealso|Political career of Arnold Schwarzenegger}}
Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the [[California recall election, 2003|2003 California recall]] election for Governor of California on the August 6, 2003 episode of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;/&gt; As a candidate in the recall election, Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the &quot;Governator&quot; (referring to ''The Terminator'' movies, see above) and &quot;The Running Man&quot; (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election &quot;Total Recall&quot; (yet another Schwarzenegger starrer). Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one debate on September 24, 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstDebate&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Grey|first=Barry|title=First debate in California recall election: Snapshot of a political system in crisis |date=2003-11-06 |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/sep2003/cali-s06.shtml |work=wsws.org |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor [[Gray Davis]] being removed from office with 55.4% of the ''Yes'' vote in favor of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat [[Cruz Bustamante]], fellow Republican [[Tom McClintock]], and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received less than 30% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3 million votes. Under the regulations of the [[California Constitution]], no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the first foreign-born governor of California since [[Ireland]]-born Governor [[John G. Downey]] in 1862.

As soon as Schwarzenegger was elected governor, [[Willie Lewis Brown, Jr.|Willie Brown]] said he would start a drive to recall the governor. Schwarzenegger was equally entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up [[gridlock]]. Building on a catchphrase from a sketch partly parodying his bodybuilding career, Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians &quot;[[girlie men]],&quot; (a reference from a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch called &quot;[[Hans and Franz]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;SFGirlieMen&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwarzenegger deems opponents 'girlie-men' |date=2004-07-18 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/07/18/MNGH57NKAF1.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CaliforniaStateCapitolGovernorOffice.JPG|thumb|left|The Governor's office in the [[California State Capitol]]]]

Schwarzenegger enjoyed a large degree of success and victories in his early governorship,&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/28/local/me-lopez28 LA Times article]&lt;/ref&gt; including repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses being given out to illegal immigrants, but later began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a [[California special election, 2005|special election]] he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He would later comment that &quot;no one could win if the opposition raised 160 million dollars to defeat you.&quot;

Schwarzenegger then went against the advice of fellow Republican strategists and appointed a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his Chief of Staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Press Release|url=http://gov.ca.gov/press-release/1191/|accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next [[gubernatorial]] election.

He has appeared alongside his fellow actor from ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'', Jackie Chan, in a government advertisement to combat copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jackie Chan and Arnold vs Piracy |publisher=Google Video |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6443035544827856436&amp;q=Jackie+Chan&amp;pr=goog-sl |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger ran for re-election against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Phil Angelides]], the [[California State Treasurer]], in the [[California gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 elections]], held on November 7, 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for Angelides, a margin of well over one million votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Election{{ndash}} Governor |publisher=California Secretary of State |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070219111658/http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/gov/00.htm |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The election further enhanced his political credentials.

It is rumored that Schwarzenegger might run for the [[United States Senate]] in 2010 (he will be term-limited then), if incumbent Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] retires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/22/AR2006122201476.html|title=Schwarzenegger Remakes Himself as Environmentalist |publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2008-07-13|first=John |last=Pomfret}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and [[bodybuilding]] as building blocks to escape a depressing home.&lt;ref name=&quot;governG2&quot;/&gt; Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as [[obsessed]] with power and quotes him as saying, &quot;I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential{{ndash}} I was always fascinated by people in control of other people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;governG2&quot;/&gt; Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter [[politics]], but he says, &quot;I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and Sargent Shriver became my heroes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LAWarn&quot;/&gt; Eunice Kennedy Shriver was sister of [[John F. Kennedy]], and [[mother-in-law]] to Schwarzenegger, Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and [[father-in-law]] to Schwarzenegger. According to the 2005 Year-in-Review issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, supporters of Schwarzenegger are hoping to amend the [[Constitution]] so that he can run for [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LAWarn&quot;/&gt; Indeed, in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', Schwarzenegger is portrayed as the President and in the Sylvester Stallone movie ''[[Demolition Man]]'', it is revealed there was an amendment to the constitution that allowed him to become President.

Schwarzenegger does not accept his governor's salary of $175,000 per year, and instead donates it to charities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taxformsre&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Soraya |title=News: Schwarzenegger releases tax returns |publisher=OCRegister.com |url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/atoz/article_1102616.php |date=2006-04-15 |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger's endorsement in the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|Republican primary]] of the [[2008 U.S. Presidential election]] was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates [[Rudy Giuliani]] and Senator [[John McCain]], Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani dropped out of the Presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in Florida, and endorsed McCain. Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library]] in [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]], [[California]]. The following day, he endorsed McCain, joking, &quot;It's Rudy's fault!&quot; (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind).&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|url=weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/blog/2008/01/arnold_opens_flood_of_mccain_e.html|title=Arnold opens 'flood' of McCain endorsements|accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger's endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCain's campaign; both spoke about their environmental concerns and concerns for the economy.

====Amendment of Three Strikes Law====
Governor Schwarzenegger played a significant role in opposing Proposition 66, a proposed amendment of the Californian [[Three Strikes Law]], in November 2004. This amendment would have required the third felony to be either violent and/or serious in order to mandate a 25-years-to-life sentence. In the last week before the ballot, governor Arnold Schwarzenegger launched an intensive campaign&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F6PBldQxZc&amp;feature=related TV-commercial of Arnold Schwarzenegger against Proposition 66]&lt;/ref&gt; against Proposition 66.&lt;ref&gt; [http://articles.latimes.com/2004/nov/01/local/me-campaign1 Megan Garvey and Robert Salladay &quot;Prop. 66 in Tough Fight&quot;, LAtimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that &quot;it would release 26,000 dangerous criminals and rapists&quot;.

===Environmental record===
On September 27, 2006 Schwarzenegger signed a bill creating the nation’s first cap on greenhouse gas emissions. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state’s greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California’s emissions by 25 percent to 1990’s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/27/AR2006092700174.html &quot;Schwarzenegger Signs Global Warming Bill&quot;] ''Washington Post''. September 27, 2008. Accessed May 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006 allowing California to work with the Northeast’s Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. They plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the amount of carbon credits they have will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan is set to be in effect in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Oct17/0,4670,GlobalWarmingSchwarzenegger,00.html &quot;Cal Joins Northeast Global Warming Fight&quot;] ''Fox News''.

In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint. Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his [[Hummer H1|Hummer]]s to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed solar panels to heat his home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/04/02/8403410/index.htm &quot;The Governator's green agenda&quot;] ''Fortune Magazine''.

In 2005, [[Peter Pilz]], from the [[Austrian Green Party]], demanded that parliament revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship. This demand was based on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act that states: ''A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship, if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DamageAustria&quot;/&gt; Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]) had indeed done damage to Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger explained his actions by referring to the fact that his only duty as Governor of California was to prevent an error in the judicial system.

In honor of its most famous son, Schwarzenegger's home town of [[Graz]] had its [[Association football|soccer]] stadium named The Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium. It is the home of both [[Grazer AK]] and [[Sturm Graz]]. Following the [[Stanley Williams]] execution and after street protests in his hometown, several local politicians began a campaign to remove Schwarzenegger's name from the stadium. Schwarzenegger responded, saying that &quot;to spare the responsible politicians of the city of Graz further concern, I withdraw from them as of this day the right to use my name in association with the Liebenau Stadium,&quot; and set a tight deadline of just a couple of days to remove his name. Graz officials removed Schwarzenegger's name from the stadium in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Graz removes Schwarzenegger name |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4560182.stm |date=2005-12-26 |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now officially titled [[UPC-Arena]].

The Sun Valley Resort has a short ski trail called ''Arnold's Run'', named after Schwarzenegger (It was named after him in 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.mtexpress.com/2001/01-12-05/01-12-05arnoldsrun.htm|title=And … here’s

He bought the first [[Hummer]] manufactured for [[civilian]] use in 1992, a model so large, 6,300 lb (2900&amp;nbsp;kg) and 7 feet (2.1&amp;nbsp;m) wide, that it is classified as a large truck and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to it. During the Gubernatorial Recall campaign he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about [[United States dollar|US$]]21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the California Hydrogen Highway Network, and gained a [[U.S. Department of Energy]] grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thanks to Arnold, California to Pave the Hydrogen Highway |publisher=BMW World |url=http://www.usautoparts.net/bmw/hydrogen/schwarzenegger.htm |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HUMMER H2H Hydrogen Powered Experimental Vehicle |publisher=About.com |url=http://trucks.about.com/od/hybridcar/a/hummer_h2h.htm |accessdate=2008-04-18 |last=Wickell |first=Dale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is an expert level skier. On December 26, 2006, he underwent a 90-minute operation in which cables and screws were used to wire the broken bone back together. He was released from the [[St. John's Health Center]] on December 30, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Schwarzenegger cleared to resume duties after surgery |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2006-12-26 |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger did not delay his second oath of office on January 5, 2007, although he was still on crutches at the time.

Schwarzenegger has twice crashed motorcycles on public highways, injuring himself in the process. On January 8, 2006, while riding his [[Harley Davidson]] [[motorcycle]] in Los Angeles, with his son Patrick in the sidecar, another driver backed into the street he was riding on, causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed. While his son and the other driver were unharmed, the governor sustained a minor injury to his lip, forcing him to get 15 [[surgical suture|stitches]]. &quot;No citations were issued&quot; said Officer Jason Lee, a [[Los Angeles Police Department]] spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10811025/|title=No Charges Against Schwarzenegger|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger, who famously rode motorcycles in [[the Terminator|the ''Terminator'' movies]], has never obtained an M-1 or M-2 endorsement on his [[California]] [[driver's license]] that would allow him to legally ride a motorcycle without a sidecar on the street. Previously, on December 9, 2001, he broke six [[rib]]s and was hospitalized for four days after a motorcycle crash in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;MotorAccident&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Associated Press|title=Schwarzenegger, son get in motorcycle accident |publisher=USA Today |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-01-09-schwarzenegger-accident_x.htm |date=2006-01-09 |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue; medical experts predict he will require heart valve replacement surgery in the next two to eight years as his current valve degrades. Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve, the only permanent solution available at the time of his surgery, because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise.&lt;ref name=&quot;ElectHeart&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Schwarzenegger Has Elective Heart Surgery |publisher=[[New York Times]] |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6D9113FF93BA25757C0A961958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fS%2fSchwarzenegger%2c%20Arnold |date=1997-04-18 |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His financial independence came from a series of successful business ventures and investments. In 1968, Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder [[Franco Columbu]] started a bricklaying business.

===Planet Hollywood===
{{see also|Planet Hollywood}}
Arnold Schwarzenegger was a founding celebrity investor in the [[Planet Hollywood]] chain of international theme restaurants (modeled after the [[Hard Rock Cafe]]) along with [[Bruce Willis]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], and [[Demi Moore]]. Schwarzenegger severed his financial ties with the business in early 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;planetar&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnold leaves planet |date=2000-01-25 |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/news.asp?id=71 |work=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger said the company had not had the success he had hoped for, claiming he wanted to focus his attention on &quot;new US global business ventures&quot; and his movie career.&lt;ref name=&quot;planetar&quot;/&gt;

===Net worth===
Schwarzenegger's net worth has been conservatively estimated at $100 – $200 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;100million&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Lance |title=Schwarzenegger worth $100 million, experts say |date=2003-08-17 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/08/17/TAXES.TMP |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, he invested his [[bodybuilding]] and [[movie]] earnings in an array of [[stocks]], [[bond (finance)|bonds]], privately controlled [[companies]], and [[real estate]] holdings in the U.S. and [[worldwide]], so his fortune is sometimes estimated as high as $800 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gov.

==Allegations of sexual and personal misconduct==
[[Image:Arnold Schwarzenegger sexual harassment protestors750.jpg|thumb|[[Code Pink]] protesting against Schwarzenegger]]
During his initial campaign for governor, allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against Schwarzenegger (dubbed ''Gropegate'').&lt;ref name=&quot;grope1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Sex scandal draws Arnie apology |date=2004-03-10 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3159122.stm |work=BBC |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the last five days before the election, news reports appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' recounting allegations of sexual misconduct from several individual women, six of whom eventually came forward with their personal stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;behaving badly&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Schwarzenegger sorry for behaving 'badly' toward women |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/02/recall.schwarzenegger/index.html |date=2003-10-03 |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the women claimed he had grabbed their breasts, a fourth said he placed his hand under her skirt on her buttock. A fifth woman claimed Schwarzenegger tried to take off her bathing suit in a hotel elevator, and the last says he pulled her onto his lap and asked her about a particular sex act.&lt;ref name=&quot;grope1&quot;/&gt;

Schwarzenegger admitted that he has &quot;behaved badly sometimes&quot; and apologized, but also stated that &quot;a lot of (what) you see in the stories is not true.&quot; This came after an interview in adult magazine ''[[Oui (magazine)|Oui]]'' from 1977 surfaced, in which Schwarzenegger discussed attending sexual orgies and using substances like [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schwarzenegger's Sex Talk |publisher=The Smoking Gun |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/arnoldinter1.html |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning [[Mr. Olympia]] in the 1975 documentary film ''[[Pumping Iron]].'' In an interview with ''GQ'' magazine in October 2007, Schwarzenegger said, &quot;[Marijuana] is not a drug. It's a leaf. My drug was pumping iron, trust me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannabis&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/29/local/me-arnold29 |title=Governor says marijuana is not a drug, 'it's a leaf'  |date=2007-10-29 |work=Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; His spokesperson later said the comment was meant to be a joke.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannabis&quot;/&gt;

British television personality [[Anna Richardson (presenter)|Anna Richardson]] settled a libel lawsuit in August 2006 against Schwarzenegger and two of his top aides, Sean Walsh and publicist Sheryl Main.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwarzenegger libel 'settled' |date=2006-08-26 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/5288194.stm |work=BBC |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A joint statement read: &quot;The parties are content to put this matter behind them and are pleased that this legal dispute has now been settled.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AR&quot;/&gt; Richardson claimed they tried to tarnish her reputation by dismissing her allegations that Schwarzenegger touched her breast during a press event (for ''[[The Sixth Day]]'') in [[London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AR2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=UK judge allows Arnie libel case |date=2005-03-23 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4375679.stm |work=BBC |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed Walsh and Main libeled her in a ''Los Angeles Times'' article when they contended she encouraged his behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!--ACCORDING TO [[WP:Style]], places of b./d. must be listed in the text proper--&gt;
'''Christopher Columbus''' (1451&lt;ref&gt;born between August 25 and October 31, 1451&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; May 20, 1506) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[navigator]], [[colonialist|colonizer]] and [[explorer]] whose voyages across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] led to general European awareness of the [[America (continent)|American continents]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]].  Though not the first to reach the Americas from [[Afro-Eurasia]]{{mdash}}preceded some five hundred years by [[Leif Ericson]], and [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact|perhaps by others]]{{mdash}}Columbus initiated widespread contact between [[Demography of Europe|Europeans]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous Americans]].  With his several hapless attempts at establishing a settlement on the island of [[Hispaniola]], he personally initiated the process of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]] which foreshadowed general [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] of the &quot;[[New World]].&quot;  (The term &quot;[[pre-Columbian]]&quot; is usually used to refer to the peoples and cultures of the Americas before the arrival of Columbus and his European successors.)

His initial 1492 voyage came at a critical time of growing national [[imperialism]] and [[Competition (economics)|economic competition]] between [[History of Europe#Renaissance|developing nation states]] seeking wealth from the establishment of [[trade route]]s and [[Colonialism|colonies]].  In this [[politics|sociopolitical]] climate, Columbus's far-fetched scheme won the attention of [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] of Spain.  Severely underestimating the [[circumference]] of the [[Earth]], he hypothesized that a westward route from [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] to [[East Indies|the Indies]] would be shorter and more direct than the overland [[trade route]] through [[Arabia]].  If true, this would allow Spain entry into the lucrative [[spice trade]]{{mdash}}heretofore commanded by the [[Arabs]] and [[Italians]].  Following his plotted course, he instead landed within the [[Bahamas|Bahamas Archipelago]] at a locale he named ''San Salvador''.  Mistaking the [[North America|North-American]] island for the [[East Asia|East-Asian]] mainland, he referred to its inhabitants as &quot;Indians&quot;.

Academic consensus is that Columbus was born in [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], though there are [[Origin theories of Christopher Columbus|other theories]]. The name ''Christopher Columbus'' is the Anglicisation of the [[Latin]] ''Christophorus Columbus''.  The name is rendered in modern Italian as ''Cristoforo Colombo'', in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as ''Cristóvão Colombo'' (formerly ''Christovam Colom''), and in Spanish as ''Cristóbal Colón''.

The anniversary of Columbus' 1492 landing in the Americas ([[Columbus Day]]) is observed throughout the Americas and in Spain on October 12.

==Early life==

&lt;!--THIS SECTION IS LARGELY BASED ON BRITANNICA AND MORISON's ''Christopher Columbus''--&gt;
According to general assumption, nevertheless disputed, Christopher Columbus was born between August and October 1451 in [[Genoa]] (nowadays part of Italy).&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, William D., and Carla Rahn Phillips. ''The Worlds of Christopher Columbus''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992. Page 9. &lt;br&gt;&quot;''Even with less than a complete record, however, scholars can state with assurance that Columbus was born in the republic of Genoa in northern Italy, although perhaps not in the city itself, and that his family made a living in the wool business as weavers and merchants. [...] The two main early biographies of Columbus have been taken as literal truth by hundreds of writers, in large part because they were written by individual closely connected to Columbus or his writings. [...] Both biographies have serious shortcomings as evidence.''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Domenico Colombo]], a middle-class [[wool]] [[Weaving (disambiguation)|weaver]] - who later also had a [[cheese]] [[stand]] where his son was a helper - working between Genoa and [[Savona]]. His mother was [[Susanna Fontanarossa]]. Bartolomeo, Giovanni Pellegrino and Giacomo were his brothers. Bartolomeo worked in a [[cartography]] workshop in [[Lisbon]] for at least part of his adulthood.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt; Encyclopedia Britannica, 1993 ed., Vol. 16, pp. 605ff / Morison, ''Christopher Columbus'', 1955 ed., pp. 14ff&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 14, he attended [[Henry the navigator|Prince Henry's]] school of navigation in [[Sagres]], [[Portugal]]. He spoke a Genoese dialect. In one of his writings, Columbus claims to have gone to the sea at the age of 10. In 1470 the Columbus Family moved to Savona, where Domenico took over a tavern. In the same year, Columbus was on a Genoese ship hired in the service of [[René I of Anjou]] to support his attempt to conquer the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. 

In 1473 Columbus began his apprenticeship as business agent for the important Centurione, Di Negro and Spinola families of Genoa. Later he allegedly made a trip to [[Chios]], a Genoese colony in the [[Aegean Sea]]. In May 1476, he took part in an armed convoy sent by Genoa to carry a valuable cargo to northern Europe. He docked in Bristol, Galway, in Ireland and was possibly in Iceland in 1477. In 1479 Columbus reached his brother Bartolomeo in [[Lisbon]], keeping on trading for the Centurione family. He married Filipa Moniz Perestrello, daughter of the [[Porto Santo]] governor, the Portuguese nobleman of Genoese origin [[Bartolomeu Perestrello]]. In 1479 or 1480, his son, [[Diego Columbus|Diego]], was born.

[[Image:Conceptions Colomb map-fr.svg|thumb|Columbus' geographical conceptions.]]
Europe had long enjoyed a safe land passage to China and India— sources of valued [[goods]] such as [[silk]], [[spices]], and [[opium|opiates]]— under the [[hegemony]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] (the [[Pax Mongolica]], or ''Mongol peace''). With the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, the land route to Asia became more difficult. The Columbus brothers had a different idea. By the 1480s, they had developed a plan to travel to the Indies, then construed roughly as all of south and east Asia, by sailing directly west across the &quot;[[Ocean Sea]],&quot; ''i.e.,'' the Atlantic.

[[Washington Irving]]'s 1828 biography of Columbus popularized the idea that Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because Europeans thought [[flat earth|the Earth was flat]].&lt;ref name=book3&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul F|last=Boller | title=Not So!:Popular Myths about America from Columbus to Clinton | year=1995 | id=ISBN 9780195091861}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the primitive maritime navigation of the time relied on the stars and the curvature of the [[spherical Earth]]. The knowledge that the Earth was spherical was widespread and the means of calculating its diameter using an astrolabe was known to both scholars and navigators&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Jeffrey Burton 1991. ''Inventing the Flat Earth. Columbus and modern historians'', Praeger, New York, Westport, London 1991;&lt;br /&gt;Zinn, Howard 1980. ''A People's History of the United States'', HarperCollins 2001. p.2&lt;/ref&gt;. The spherical view of the earth had been the general opinion of Ancient Greek science, and continued as the standard view in the Middle Ages (for example of [[Bede]] in ''The Reckoning of Time''). In fact the Earth had generally been [[Spherical Earth|believed to be spherical]] since the 4th century BCE by most scholars and almost all navigators{{Fact|date=December 2007}}, and [[Eratosthenes]] had measured the diameter of the Earth with good precision in the second century BC.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sagan 40,04147km&quot;&gt;Sagan, Carl. ''Cosmos''; the mean circumference of the Earth is 40,041.47 km.&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus put forth (incorrect) arguments based on a significantly smaller diameter for the Earth, claiming that Asia could be easily reached by sailing west across the Atlantic. Most scholars accepted [[Ptolemy]]'s correct assessment that the terrestrial landmass (for Europeans of the time, comprising Eurasia and Africa) occupied 180 [[longitude|degrees]] of the terrestrial sphere, and correctly dismissed Columbus's claim that the Earth was much smaller, and that Asia was only a few thousand nautical miles to the west of Europe. Columbus' error was put down to his lack of experience in navigation at sea.&lt;ref name = &quot;Morison-Admiral&quot;&gt; Morison, Samuel Eliot, ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: The Life of Christopher Columbus'' Boston, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus believed the (incorrect) calculations of [[Marinus of Tyre]], putting the landmass at 225 degrees, leaving only 135 degrees of water. Moreover, Columbus believed that one degree represented a shorter distance on the earth's surface than was actually the case. Finally, he read maps as if the distances were calculated in [[Mile#Other miles|Italian mile]]s (1,238 meters&lt;!--Shouldn't it be 1,520 m--&gt;). Accepting the length of a degree to be 56⅔ miles, from the writings of [[Alfraganus]], he therefore calculated the circumference of the Earth as 25,255 kilometers at most, and the distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan as 3,000 Italian miles (3,700 km, or 2,300 statute miles) Columbus did not realize Al-Farghani used the much longer Arabic mile (about 1,830 m).

[[Image:ColombusNotesToMarcoPolo.jpg|thumb|Handwritten notes by Christopher Colombus on the latin edition of [[Marco Polo]]'s ''Le livre des merveilles''.]]
The main problem was that experts did not accept his estimate. The true circumference of the Earth is about 40,000 km (25,000 sm), a figure established by [[Eratosthenes]] in the second century BC,&lt;ref name = &quot;Sagan 40,04147km&quot;/&gt;   and the distance from the Canary Islands to Japan 19,600 km (12,200 sm). No ship that was readily available in the 15th century could carry enough food and fresh water for such a journey. Most European sailors and navigators concluded, likely correctly, that sailors undertaking a westward voyage from Europe to Asia non-stop would die of thirst or starvation long before reaching their destination. Spain, however, having completed an expensive war, was desperate for a competitive edge over other European countries in trade with the East Indies. Columbus promised such an advantage.

While Columbus' calculations underestimated the circumference of the Earth and the distance from the Canary Islands to Japan by the standards of his peers as well as in fact, almost all Europeans held the mistaken opinion that the aquatic expanse between Europe and Asia was uninterrupted.  As the 16th century developed it was the route to America, rather than to Japan, that gave Spain a competitive edge in developing an overseas empire.

There was a further element of key importance in the plans of Columbus, a closely-held fact discovered by or otherwise learned by Columbus: '''the trade winds.'''  A brisk wind from the east, commonly called an &quot;'''easterly'''&quot;, propelled Santa Maria, La Nina, &amp; La Pinta for '''5 weeks''' from the Canaries.  To return to Spain eastward against this prevailing wind would have required '''several months''' of an arduous sailing technique, called [[beating]], during which food &amp; drinkable water would have been utterly exhausted.  Columbus returned home by following prevailing winds northeastward from the southern zone of the North Atlantic to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where prevailing winds are eastward (westerly) to the coastlines of Western Europe, where the winds curve southward towards the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|title=The First Voyage Log

&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Columbus was wrong about degrees of longitude to be traversed and wrong about distance per degree, but he was right about a more vital fact:  how to use the North Atlantic's great circular wind pattern, clockwise in direction, to get home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/eurvoya/columbus.html|title=Christopher Columbus and the Spanish Empire

Some mean that his confidence in that land was within reach, was based on his travel in 1477 [http://www.cristobalcolondeibiza.com/eng/eng12.htm (1476-1477)], which may have taken him to Baffin Island at 73 degrees north  [http://wissen.spiegel.de/wissen/dokument/06/38/dokument.html?titel=Gro%C3%9Fartige+Idee&amp;id=13488360&amp;top=SPIEGEL&amp;suchbegriff=&amp;quellen=&amp;vl=0 (in German)]. On this tour he could also get information from [http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/archeo/oracles/norse/40.htm norse sailors and inuit kayakers] trading on the long coast extending from north to south at about this longitude, almost to Africa. [http://www.vsnrweb-publications.org.uk A History of Norway..., 12th century p. 3, lines 2-5]: ''This country, which was discovered, settled and confirmed in the universal faith by Icelanders, is the western boundary of Europe, almost touching the African islands where the waters of ocean flood in.''

===Funding campaign===

In 1485, Columbus presented his plans to [[John II of Portugal|John II]], [[King of Portugal]]. He proposed the king equip three sturdy ships and grant Columbus one year's time to sail out into the [[Atlantic]], search for a western route to [[Orient]], and then return home. Columbus also requested he be made &quot;Great Admiral of the Ocean&quot;, created governor of any and all lands he discovered, and given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands discovered. The king submitted the proposal to his experts, who rejected it. It was their considered opinion that Columbus' proposed route of {{convert|2400|mi|km|-1}} was, in fact, far too short.&lt;ref name = &quot;Morison-Admiral&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Arms of Columbus.jpg|thumb|left|Arms of Columbus]]

In 1488 Columbus appealed to the court of Portugal once again, and once again John invited him to an audience. It too was to come to nothing, for not long afterwards came the arrival of Portugal's native son [[Bartholomeu Dias]] from a successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa. Portugal was no longer interested in trailblazing a western route to the East. 

Columbus travelled from Portugal once more to both [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]], but he received encouragement from neither. Previously he had his brother sound out [[Henry VII of England]], to see if the [[English monarch]] might not be more amenable to Columbus' proposal. After much carefully considered hesitation Henry's invitation came, too late. Columbus had already committed himself to Spain.

[[Image:Monumento a Colón (Madrid) 02b.jpg|thumb|200px|right|&lt;small&gt;Columbus and Queen Isabella. Detail of the Columbus monument in [[Madrid]] (1885).&lt;/small&gt;]]

He had sought an audience from the monarchs [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], who had united the largest kingdoms of Spain by marrying, and were ruling together. On May 1, 1486, permission having been granted, Columbus laid his plans before Queen Isabella, who, in turn, referred it to a committee. After the passing of much time, these savants of Spain, like their counterparts in Portugal, reported back that Columbus had judged the distance to Asia much too short. They pronounced the idea impractical, and advised their Royal Highnesses to pass on the proposed venture.

However, to keep Columbus from taking his ideas elsewhere, and perhaps to keep their options open, the King and Queen of Spain gave him an annual annuity of 12,000 ''[[maravedis]]'' ($840) and in 1489 furnished him with a letter ordering all Spanish cities and towns to provide him food and lodging at no cost.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will ''&quot;The Story of Civilization&quot;'' vol. vi, &quot;The Reformation&quot;. Chapter XIII, page 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

After continually lobbying at the Spanish court and two years of negotiations, he finally had success in 1492. Ferdinand and Isabella had just conquered [[Granada]], the last Muslim stronghold on the [[Iberian peninsula]], and they received Columbus in [[Córdoba (Spain)|Córdoba]], in the ''[[Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos|Alcázar]]'' castle. Isabella turned Columbus down on the advice of her confessor, and he was leaving town in despair, when Ferdinand intervened. Isabella then sent a royal guard to fetch him and Ferdinand later rightfully claimed credit for being &quot;the principal cause why those islands were discovered&quot;. King Ferdinand is referred to as &quot;losing his patience&quot; in this issue, but this cannot be proven.

About half of the financing was to come from private Italian investors, whom Columbus had already lined up. Financially broke after the Granada campaign, the monarchs left it to the royal treasurer to shift funds among various royal accounts on behalf of the enterprise. Columbus was to be made &quot;Admiral of the Seas&quot; and would receive a portion of all profits. The terms were unusually generous, but as his own son later wrote, the monarchs did not really expect him to return.

According to the contract that Columbus made with King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, if Columbus discovered any new islands or mainland, he would receive many high rewards. In terms of power, he would be given the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea (Atlantic Ocean) and appointed Viceroy and Governor of all the new lands. He had the right to nominate three persons, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to 10 percent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity; this part was denied to him in the contract, although it was one of his demands.
Finally, he would also have the option of buying one-eighth interest in any commercial venture with the new lands and receive one-eighth of the profits.

Columbus was later arrested in 1500 and supplanted from these posts. After his death, Columbus's sons, Diego and Fernando, took legal action to enforce their father's contract. Many of the smears against Columbus were initiated by the Spanish crown during these lengthy court cases,  known as the ''pleitos colombinos''.  The family had some success in their first litigation, as a judgment of 1511 confirmed Diego's position as Viceroy, but reduced his powers.  Diego resumed litigation in 1512, which lasted until 1536, and further disputes continued until 1790.&lt;ref&gt;Mark McDonald, &quot;Ferdinand Columbus, Renaissance Collector (1488-1539)&quot;, 2005, British Museum Press, ISBN 9780714126449 &lt;/ref&gt;

===First voyage===

[[Image:Columbus Taking Possession.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A depiction of Columbus claiming possession of the [[New World]] in a [[chromolithograph]] made by the Prang Education Company in 1893.]]
On the evening of August 3, 1492, Columbus departed from [[Palos de la Frontera]] with three ships; one larger [[carrack]], ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'', nicknamed ''Gallega'' (''the Galician''), and two smaller [[caravel]]s, ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' (''the Painted'') and ''Santa Clara'', nicknamed ''[[Niña]]'' after her owner Juan Niño of Moguer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenina.com/nina2.html The Columbus Foundation: Santa Clara]&lt;/ref&gt; They were property of [[Juan de la Cosa]] and the [[The Pinzón Brothers|Pinzón brothers]] ([[Martin Alonzo Pinzón|Martin Alonzo]] and [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzón|Vicente Yáñez]]), but the monarchs forced the [[Palos]] inhabitants to contribute to the expedition. Columbus first sailed to the [[Canary Islands]], which were owned by [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], where he restocked the provisions and made repairs, and on September 6, he started what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean.      

Land was sighted at 2 [[12-hour clock|a.m.]] on October 12, 1492, by a sailor named [[Rodrigo de Triana]] (also known as Juan Rodríguez Bermejo) aboard ''Pinta''.&lt;ref name=book2&gt;{{cite book | author= Clements R. Markham, ed | title=The Journal of Christopher Columbus (During His First Voyage) | Hakluyt Society (1893) | id={{ASIN|B000I1OMXM}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus called the island (in what is now [[The Bahamas]]) ''San Salvador''; the natives called it [[Guanahani]]. Exactly which island in the Bahamas this corresponds to is an unresolved topic; prime candidates are [[Samana Cay]], [[Plana Cays]], or [[San Salvador Island]] (named San Salvador in 1925 in the belief that it was Columbus's San Salvador). The [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] he encountered, the [[Lucayan]], [[Taíno]] or [[Arawak]], were peaceful and friendly. From the October 12, 1492 entry in his journal he wrote of them, &quot;Many of the men I have seen have scars on their bodies, and when I made signs to them to find out how this happened, they indicated that people from other nearby islands come to San Salvador to capture them; they defend themselves the best they can.  I believe that people from the mainland come here to take them as slaves.  They ought to make good and skilled servants, for they repeat very quickly whatever we say to them.  I think they can very easily be made Christians, for they seem to have no religion.  If it pleases our Lord, I will take six of them to Your Highnesses when I depart, in order that they may learn our language.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Fuson, ed ''The Log of Christopher Columbus'', Tab Books, 1992, International Marine Publishing, ISBN 0-87742-316-4 &lt;/ref&gt;  Lacking modern weaponry and even metal-forged swords or pikes, he remarked upon their tactical vulnerability, writing, &quot;I could conquer the whole of them with 50 men, and govern them as I pleased.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2004/10/12/News/Columbus.Day.Sparks.Debate.Over.Explorers.Legacy-1425748.shtml Columbus Day sparks debate over explorer's legacy - News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Flag of Christopher Columbus.svg|200px|left|thumb|Captain's Ensign of Columbus' Ships]]
Columbus also explored the northeast coast of [[Cuba]] (landed on October 28) and the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]], by December 5. Here, the ''[[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa Maria]]'' ran aground on [[Christmas]] morning 1492 and had to be abandoned. He was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind. Columbus left 39 men and founded the settlement of ''[[La Navidad]]'' in what is now present-day [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Maclean, Frances| title=The Lost Fort of Columbus| url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/fort-of-columbus-200801.html| publisher=''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]''| month=January | year=2008| accessdate=2008-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before returning to Spain, Columbus also kidnapped some ten to twenty-five natives and took them back with him. Only seven or eight of the native ''Indians'' arrived in Spain alive, but they made quite an impression on Seville.&lt;ref name=book2&gt;{{cite book | author= James W. Loewen | title=Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong | Touchstone Books (1995) | id={{ASIN|1402579373}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus headed for Spain, but another storm forced him into [[Lisbon]]. He anchored next to the King's harbor patrol ship on March 4, 1493 in Portugal. After spending more than one week in Portugal, he set sail for Spain. He reached Spain on March 15, 1493.  Word of his finding new lands [[Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage|rapidly spread throughout Europe]].

There is increasing modern scientific evidence that this voyage also brought [[syphilis]] back from the New World. Many of the crew members who served on this voyage later joined the army of [[King Charles VIII]] in his invasion of Italy in 1495 resulting in the spreading of the disease across Europe and as many as 5 million deaths.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/01/14/syphilis-columbus.html|title = Study traces origins of syphilis in Europe to New World|accessdate = 2008-01-15|last = CBC News Staff|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = January}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0000148|title = On the Origin of the Treponematoses: A Phylogenetic Approach|accessdate = 2008-01-21|last = Harper, Kristin, et al|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = January}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second voyage===

[[Image:Columbus2.PNG|thumb|300px|left|Second voyage.]]

Columbus left [[Cádiz]], Spain, on September 24, 1493 to find new territories, with 17 ships carrying supplies, and about 1,200 men to colonize the region. On October 13, the ships left the Canary Islands as they had on the first voyage, following a more southerly course.

On November 3, 1493, Columbus sighted a rugged island that he named [[Dominica]] (Latin for Sunday); later that day, he landed at [[Marie-Galante]], which he named Santa Maria la Galante. After sailing past [[Les Saintes]] (Los Santos, The Saints), he arrived at [[Guadeloupe]] ([[Santa María de Guadalupe]] de Extremadura, after the image of the Virgin Mary venerated at the Spanish monastery of [[Villuercas]], in Guadalupe, Spain), which he explored between November 4 and November 10, 1493.

The exact course of his voyage through the [[Lesser Antilles]] is debated, but it seems likely that he turned north, sighting and naming several islands, including [[Montserrat]] (for Santa Maria de Montserrate, after the Blessed Virgin of the Monastery of Montserrat, which is located on the Mountain of Montserrat, in Catalonia, Spain), [[Antigua]] (after a church in Seville, Spain, called Santa Maria la Antigua, meaning &quot;Old St. Mary's&quot;), [[Redonda]] (for Santa Maria la Redonda, Spanish for &quot;round&quot;, owing to the island's shape), [[Nevis]] (derived from the Spanish, Nuestra Señora de las Nieves, meaning &quot;Our Lady of the Snows&quot;, because Columbus thought the clouds over Nevis Peak made the island resemble a snow-capped mountain), [[Saint Kitts]] (for [[St. Christopher]], patron of sailors and travelers), [[Sint Eustatius]] (for the early Roman martyr, [[Saint Eustace|St. Eustachius]]), [[Saba]] (also for St. Christopher?), [[Saint Martin]] (San Martin), and [[Saint Croix]] (from the Spanish ''Santa Cruz'', meaning &quot;[[Holy Cross]]&quot;). He also sighted the island chain of the [[Virgin Islands]] (and named them Islas de Santa Ursula y las Once Mil Virgenes, [[Saint Ursula]] and the 11,000 Virgins, a cumbersome name that was usually shortened, both on maps of the time and in common parlance, to Islas Virgenes), and he also named the islands of [[Virgin Gorda]] (the fat virgin), [[Tortola]], and [[Peter Island]] (San Pedro).

He continued to the [[Greater Antilles]], and landed at [[Puerto Rico]] (originally San Juan Bautista, in honor of Saint John the Baptist, a name that was later supplanted by Puerto Rico (English: Rich Port) while the capital retained the name, San Juan) on November 19, 1493. One of the first skirmishes between native Americans and Europeans since the time of the Vikings&lt;ref name=book1&gt;{{cite book | author=Phillips, Jr., William D. &amp; Carla Rahn Phillips | title=The Worlds of Christopher Columbus | year=1992 | id=ISBN 9780521350976}}&lt;/ref&gt; took place when Columbus's men rescued two boys who had just been castrated by their captors.

On November 22, Columbus returned to Hispaniola, where he intended to visit [[La Navidad|Fuerte de la Navidad]] (Christmas Fort), built during his first voyage, and located on the northern coast of [[Haiti]]; Fuerte de la Navidad was found in ruins, destroyed by the native [[Taino]] people, whereupon, Columbus moved more than 100 kilometers eastwards, establishing a new settlement, which he called  [[La Isabela]], likewise on the northern coast of [[La Hispaniola|Hispaniola]], in the present-day [[Dominican Republic]]. However, [[La Isabela]] proved to be a poorly-chosen location, and the settlement was short-lived.

He left Hispaniola on April 24, 1494, arrived at [[Cuba]] (naming it Juana) on April 30. He explored the southern coast of Cuba, which he believed to be a peninsula rather than an island, and several nearby islands, including the [[Isla de la Juventud‎|Isle of Pines]] (Isla de las Pinas, later known as La Evangelista, The Evangelist). He reached [[Jamaica]] on May 5.  He retraced his route to Hispaniola, arriving on August 20, before he finally returned to Spain.

During his second voyage, Columbus and his men instituted a policy in Hispaniola which has been referred to by numerous historians as genocide.  The native Taino people of the island were systematically enslaved and murdered.  Hundreds were rounded up and shipped to Europe to be sold; many died en route.  For the rest of the population, Columbus demanded that all Taino under his control should bring the Spaniards gold.  Those that didn't were to have their hands cut off. Since there was, in fact, little gold to be had, the Taino fled, and the Spaniards hunted them down and killed them.  The Taino tried to mount a resistance, but the Spanish weaponry was superior, and European diseases ravaged their population.  In despair, the Taino engaged in mass suicide, even killing their own children to save them from the Spaniards.  Within two years, half of what may have been 250,000 Taino were dead.  The remainder were taken as slaves and set to work on plantations, where the mortality rate was very high.  By 1550, 60 years after Columbus landed, only a few hundred Taino were left on their island.  In another hundred years, perhaps only a handful remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newhumanist.com/md2.html |title=Christopher Columbus and the Indians by Howard Zinn |publisher=Newhumanist.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/Taino/docs/columbus.html Jack Weatherford, Examining the reputation of Christopher Columbus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/thistle/www/v9/9.11/1columbus.html 9.11 - Columbus' History of Genocide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/43a/100.html Pre-Columbian Hispaniola - Arawak/Taino Indians&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third voyage===

[[Image:Columbus3.PNG|thumb|300px|left|Third voyage.]]
[[Image:AndalusAndMorocco.png|200px|thumb|Location of city of [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]], the starting point for Columbus' third journey.]]

On May 30, 1498, Columbus left with six ships from [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda|Sanlúcar, Spain]], for his third trip to the New World. He was accompanied by the young [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]], who would later provide partial transcripts of Columbus' logs.  

Columbus led the fleet to the Portuguese island of [[Porto Santo]], his wife's native land. He then sailed to [[Madeira]] and spent some time there with the Portuguese captain João Gonçalves da Camara before sailing to the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Cape Verde]].  Columbus landed on the south coast of the island of [[Trinidad]] on July 31.  From August 4 through August 12, he explored the [[Gulf of Paria]] which separates [[Trinidad]] from [[Venezuela]].  He explored the mainland of South America, including the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]].  He also sailed to the islands of [[Chacachacare]] and [[Margarita Island]] and sighted and named [[Tobago]] (Bella Forma) and [[Grenada]] (Concepcion).  

Columbus returned to [[Hispaniola]] on August 19 to find that many of the Spanish settlers of the new colony were discontented, having been misled by Columbus about the supposedly bountiful riches of the new world. An entry in his journal from September 1498 reads, &quot;From here one might send, in the name of the Holy Trinity, as many slaves as could be sold...&quot; Indeed, as a fierce supporter of slavery, Columbus ultimately refused to baptize the native people of Hispanolia, since Catholic law forbade the enslavement of Christians. &lt;ref name = &quot;CBS-Mystery&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/17/world/main2098785.shtml Christopher Columbus: Man Of Mystery, Not Much Is Known, And Some Of What's Been Discovered Isn't Good - CBS News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus repeatedly had to deal with rebellious settlers and natives. {{Fact|date=October 2007}} He had some of his crew hanged for disobeying him. A number of returning settlers and sailors lobbied against Columbus at the Spanish court, accusing him and his brothers of gross mismanagement. On his return he was arrested for a period (see Governorship and arrest section below).

===Fourth voyage===

[[Image:Columbus4.PNG|thumb|300px|left|Fourth voyage.]]
Columbus made a fourth voyage nominally in search of the [[Strait of Malacca]] to the [[Indian Ocean]]. Accompanied by his brother [[Bartolomeo Columbus|Bartolomeo]] and his 13-year-old son [[Fernando Colón|Fernando]], he left Cádiz, Spain, on May 11, 1502, with the ships ''Capitana'', ''Gallega'', ''Vizcaína'' and ''Santiago de Palos''. He sailed to [[Arzila]] on the Moroccan coast to rescue [[Portugal|Portuguese]] soldiers whom he had heard were under siege by the [[Moors]]. On June 15, they landed at Carbet on the island of [[Martinique]] (''Martinica'').  A [[hurricane]] was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on [[Hispaniola]].  He arrived at [[Santo Domingo]] on June 29, but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction. Instead, while Columbus' ships sheltered at the mouth of the [[Rio Jaina]], the first Spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane. Columbus' ships survived with only minor damage, while twenty-nine of the thirty ships in the governor's fleet were lost to [[1492-1524 Atlantic hurricane seasons|the July 1 storm]]. In addition to the ships, 500 lives (including that of the governor, [[Francisco de Bobadilla]]) and an immense cargo of gold were surrendered to the sea. 

After a brief stop at [[Jamaica]], Columbus sailed to [[Central America]], arriving at [[Guanaja|Guanaja (Isla de Pinos)]]  in the [[Islas de la Bahía department|Bay Islands]] off the coast of [[Honduras]] on July 30.  Here Bartolomeo found native merchants and a large canoe, which was described as &quot;long as a galley&quot; and was filled with cargo.  On August 14, he landed on the American mainland at Puerto Castilla, near [[Trujillo, Honduras]].  He spent two months exploring the coasts of Honduras, [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]], before arriving in Almirante Bay, [[Panama]] on October 16.

On December 5, 1502, Columbus and his crew found themselves in a storm unlike any they had ever experienced. In his journal Columbus writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt; For nine days I was as one lost, without hope of life. Eyes never beheld the sea so angry, so high, so covered with foam. The wind not only prevented our progress, but offered no opportunity to run behind
any headland for shelter; hence we were forced to keep out in this bloody
ocean, seething like a pot on a hot fire. Never did the sky look more 
terrible; for one whole day and night it blazed like a furnace, and the lightning broke with such violence that each time I wondered if it had carried off my spars and sails; the flashes came with such fury and frightfulness that we all thought that the ship would be blasted. All
this time the water never ceased to fall from the sky; I do not say it rained, for it was like another deluge. The men were so worn out that 
they longed for death to end their dreadful suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, Samuel Eliot,''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', Boston, 1942, page 617.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Panama, Columbus learned from the natives of gold and a strait to another ocean.  After much exploration, in January 1503 he established a garrison at the mouth of the [[Rio Belen]]. On April 6 one of the ships became stranded in the river. At the same time, the garrison was attacked, and the other ships were damaged. Columbus left for Hispaniola on April 16, heading north.  On May 10 he sighted the [[Cayman Islands]], naming them &quot;''Las Tortugas''&quot; after the numerous [[sea turtle]]s there. His ships next sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of Cuba.  Unable to travel farther, on June 25, 1503, they were beached in [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica]].
[[Image:Eclipse Chistophe  Colomb.jpg|thumb|Columbus's [[lunar eclipse]]]]
For a year Columbus and his men remained stranded on Jamaica. A Spaniard, Diego Mendez, and some natives paddled a [[canoe]] to get help from [[Hispaniola]].  That island's governor, [[Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres]], detested Columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men.  In the meantime Columbus, in a desperate effort to induce the natives to continue provisioning him and his hungry men, successfully intimidated the natives by correctly predicting a [[lunar eclipse]] for February 29, 1504, using the ''[[Ephemeris]]'' of the German astronomer [[Regiomontanus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea:  A Life of Christopher Columbus'', 1942, pp. 653–54.  [[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Christopher Columbus, Mariner'', 1955, pp. 184-92.&lt;/ref&gt;  Help finally arrived, no thanks to the governor, on June 29, 1504, and Columbus and his men arrived in [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda|Sanlúcar, Spain]], on November 7.

==Governorship and arrest==

During Columbus' stint as governor and viceroy, he had been accused of governing tyrannically. {{Fact|date=March 2007}}. Columbus was physically and mentally exhausted; his body was wracked by [[arthritis]] and his eyes by [[ophthalmia]]. In October 1499, he sent two ships to Spain, asking the Court of Spain to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern.

The Court appointed [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], a member of the [[Order of Calatrava]]; however, his authority stretched far beyond what Columbus had requested. Bobadilla was given total control as governor from 1500 until his death in 1502. Arriving in Santo Domingo while Columbus was away, Bobadilla was immediately peppered with complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolomé, and Diego. Consuelo Varela, a Spanish historian, states: &quot;Even those who loved him [Columbus] had to admit the atrocities that had taken place.&quot;&lt;ref name=newspaper1&gt;{{cite news |author=Giles Tremlett |title=Lost document reveals Columbus as tyrant of the Caribbean |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/spain/article/0,,1838823,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=12 | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | date=[[2006-08-07]] | accessdate=2006-10-10  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bobadilla's 48-page report&amp;mdash;derived from the testimonies of 23 people who had seen or heard about the treatment meted out by Columbus and his brothers&amp;mdash;had originally been lost for centuries, but was rediscovered in 2005 in the Spanish archives in [[Valladolid]]. It contained an account of Columbus' seven-year reign as the first [[Governor of the Indies]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a result of these testimonies and without being allowed a word in his own defense, Columbus upon his return, had manacles placed on his arms and chains on his feet and was cast into prison to await return to Spain. He was 53 years old. 

On October 1, 1500, Columbus and his two brothers, likewise in chains, were sent back to Spain. Once in Cádiz, a grieving Columbus wrote to a friend at court:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is now seventeen years since I came to serve these princes with the Enterprise of the Indies. They made me pass eight of them in discussion, and at the end rejected it as a thing of jest. Nevertheless I persisted therein... Over there I have placed under their sovereignty more land than there is in Africa and Europe, and more than 1,700 islands... In seven years I, by the divine will, made that conquest. At a time when I was entitled to expect rewards and retirement, I was incontinently arrested and sent home loaded with chains... The accusation was brought out of malice on the basis of charges made by civilians who had revolted and wished to take possession on the land....

I beg your graces, with the zeal of faithful Christians in whom their Highnesses have confidence, to read all my papers, and to consider how I, who came from so far to serve these princes... now at the end of my days have been despoiled of my honor and my property without cause, wherein is neither justice nor mercy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', p. 576.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to testimony of 23 witnesses during his trial, Columbus regularly used barbaric acts of torture to govern Hispaniola.&lt;ref name = &quot;CBS-Mystery&quot;/&gt;

Columbus and his brothers lingered in jail for six weeks before the busy King Ferdinand ordered their release. Not long thereafter, the king and queen summoned the Columbus brothers to their presence at the [[Alhambra]] palace in [[Granada]]. There the royal couple heard the brothers' pleas; restored their freedom and their wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus' fourth voyage. But the door was firmly shut on Christopher Columbus's role as governor. From that point forward, [[Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres]] was to be the new governor of the West Indies.

==Later life==

[[Image:ColumbusHouseOfValladolid.jpg|thumb|left|A statue of the Santa Maria, Columbus' flagship in his first voyage. The statue is at the House of Columbus in [[Valladolid]], Spain, the city where Columbus died.]]

While Columbus had always given the conversion of non-believers as one reason for his explorations, he grew increasingly religious in his later years. He claimed to hear divine voices, lobbied for a new [[crusade]] to capture [[Jerusalem]], often wore [[Franciscan]] habit, and described his explorations to the &quot;paradise&quot; as part of [[God]]'s plan which would soon result in the [[Christian eschatology|Last Judgment]] and the end of the world.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

In his later years, Columbus demanded that the Spanish Crown give him 10 per cent of all profits made in the new lands, pursuant to earlier agreements. Because he had been relieved of his duties as governor, the crown did not feel bound by these contracts, and his demands were rejected. After his death his family later sued for part of the profits from trade with America in the ''pleitos colombinos''.

[[Image:Tomb-of-columbus.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Columbus's tomb in [[Seville Cathedral]]. It is borne by four statues of kings representing the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of León|Leon]], [[Aragon]], and [[Navarre]].]]
On May 20, 1506, at about the age of 55, Columbus died in [[Valladolid]], fairly wealthy from the gold his men had accumulated in Hispaniola. When he died he was still convinced that his journeys had been along the east coast of Asia. According to a study, published in February 2007, by Antonio Rodriguez Cuartero, Department of Internal Medicine of the [[University of Granada]], he died of a heart attack caused by [[reactive arthritis|Reiter's Syndrome]] (also called reactive arthritis). According to his personal diaries and notes by contemporaries, the symptoms of this illness (burning pain during urination, pain and swelling of the knees, and [[conjunctivitis]] of the eyes) were clearly visible in his last three years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/408828.html Cause of the death of Colombus (in Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

His remains were first buried in Valladolid and then at the monastery of La Cartuja in [[Seville]] (southern Spain), by the will of his son [[Diego Colón|Diego]], who had been governor of Hispaniola. Then in 1542, his remains were transferred to [[Santo Domingo]], in eastern Hispaniola. In 1795, the French took over Hispaniola, and his remains were moved to [[Havana]], Cuba. After Cuba became independent following the [[Spanish-American War]] in 1898, his remains were moved back to the [[Cathedral of Seville]] in Spain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12368307610158273876213/p0000001.htm ''Cristóbal Colón: traslación de sus restos mortales a la ciudad de Sevilla'' at Fundación Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes]&lt;/ref&gt; where they were placed on an elaborate [[catafalque]]. However, a lead box bearing an inscription identifying &quot;Don Christopher Columbus&quot; and containing fragments of bone and a bullet was discovered at Santo Domingo in 1877. 

To lay to rest claims that the wrong relics were moved to Havana and that the remains of Columbus were left buried in the cathedral of Santo Domingo, [[DNA]] samples were taken in June 2003 (''History Today'' August 2003).   The results are not conclusive.  Initial observations suggested that the bones did not appear to belong to somebody with the physique or age at death associated with Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;Giles Tremlett, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/spain/article/0,2763,1280590,00.html Young bones lay Columbus myth to rest], ''[[The Guardian]]'', August 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; DNA extraction proved difficult; only a few limited fragments of [[mitochondrial DNA]] could be isolated.  However, such as they are, these do appear to match corresponding DNA from Columbus's brother, giving support to the idea that the two had the same mother and that the body therefore may be that of Columbus.&lt;ref name=&quot;remains&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Rossella |last=Lorenzi |title= DNA Suggests Columbus Remains in Spain |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20041004/columbus.html | publisher=[[Discovery Channel|Discovery News]] |date=October 6, 2004 | accessdate=2006-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12871458/ DNA verifies Columbus’ remains in Spain], ''[[Associated Press]]'', May 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities in Santo Domingo have not allowed the remains there to be exhumed, so it is unknown if any of those remains could be from Columbus's body. The location of the Dominican remains is in the &quot;Columbus Lighthouse&quot; or Faro A Colon which is in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

==Legacy==

{{POV-section|date=February 2008}}

Sometimes thought of erroneously as the discoverer of the New World, Columbus was preceded by the various cultures and civilizations of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], as well as the [[Western world]]'s [[L'Anse aux Meadows|Vikings]]. He is regarded more accurately as the person who brought the Americas into the forefront of Western attention.  &quot;Columbus' claim to fame isn't that he got there first,&quot; explains historian Martin Dugard, &quot;it's that he stayed.&quot;&lt;ref name=dugard&gt;Dugard, Martin. The Last Voyage of Columbus. Little, Brown and Company: New York, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Equally false is the notion that he was first to envision a rounded earth.  This was known in ancient times, though largely forgotten in the Middle Ages.  By Columbus's day, educated men were in agreement as to its spherical shape, even if many or most people believed otherwise.  More contentious was the size of the earth, and whether it was possible in practical terms to cross such a vast body of water: the longest any ship (European or otherwise) had gone without making landfall did not much exceed 30 days when Columbus embarked on his first audacious voyage.

[[Image:1893 Nina Pinta Santa Maria replicas.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Replicas of the ''Niña'', ''Pinta'' and ''Santa Maria'' sailed from Spain to the [[Chicago Columbian Exposition]].]]

[[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s travel journals, published 1502-4, convinced [[Martin Waldseemüller]] that the discovered place was not India, as Columbus always believed, but a new [[continent]], and in 1507, a year after Columbus' death, Waldseemüller published a world map [[Americas#Naming|calling the new continent]] ''America'' from Vespucci's Latinized name &quot;Americus&quot;.  

Historically, the British had downplayed Columbus and emphasized the role of [[John Cabot]] as a pioneering explorer. But for the emerging United States, Cabot made a poor national hero. Veneration of Columbus in America dates back to colonial times. America itself was sometimes referred to as [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Stewart |first= George R. |authorlink= George R. Stewart |title= Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |origyear= 1945 |edition= Sentry edition (3rd) |year= 1967 |publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin]] |pages= p. 199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Columbus as a founding figure of New World nations and the use of the word Columbia spread rapidly after the American Revolution. During the last two decades of the 18th century the name &quot;Columbia&quot; was given to the federal capital [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], South Carolina's new capital city, [[Columbia, South Carolina]], the [[Columbia River]], and numerous other places. Attempts to rename the United States &quot;Columbia&quot; failed, but Columbia became a female [[national personification]] of America, similar to the male [[Uncle Sam]].{{Fact|date=February 2008}} Outside the United States the name was used in 1819 for the [[Gran Colombia|Republic of Colombia]], a precursor of the modern nation of [[Colombia]].

A candidate for sainthood in the Catholic Church in 1866, Celebration of Columbus' legacy perhaps reached a zenith in 1892 when the 400th anniversary of his first arrival in the Americas occurred. Monuments to Columbus like the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]] were erected throughout the United States and [[Latin America]] extolling him. Numerous cities, towns, counties, and streets have been named after him, including the [[capital city|capital cities]] of two U.S. [[State (United States)|states]] ([[Columbus, Ohio]] and [[Columbia, South Carolina]]). 

In 1909, descendants of Columbus undertook to dismantle the Columbus family chapel in Spain and move it to a site near [[State College]], Pennsylvania, where it may now be visited by the public.  At the museum associated with the chapel, there are a number of Columbus relics worthy of note, including the armchair which the &quot;Admiral of the Ocean Sea&quot; used at his chart table.

Culpability is sometimes placed on contemporary governments and their citizens for the hardship suffered by Native Americans during the time of Christopher Columbus. Columbus myths and celebrations are generally a positive affair, making less room for this concept in history books. Christopher Columbus was strongly criticised&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/html/20061003T220000-0500_113618_OBS_THE_LEGACIES_OF_CHRISTOPHER_COLUMBUS_.asp The legacies of Christopher Columbus - JAMAICAOBSERVER.COM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in a song by Jamaican artiste [[Burning Spear]] titled 'A Damn Blasted Liar.'  The controversial song opened a strong opinionated debate across much of the Caribbean region on the effects that Christopher Columbus and his leadership had on the region's native peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackbritain.co.uk/news/details.aspx?i=2225&amp;c=slavery&amp;h=Christopher+Columbus+tortured+slaves%2C+say+official+historical+documents Colourful | edition | weekend&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish colonization of the Americas, and the subsequent effects on the native peoples, were dramatized in the 1992 feature film ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]'' to commemorate the 500th anniversary of his landing in the Americas. *In 2003, Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]] urged Native American Latin Americans to not celebrate the [[Columbus Day]] holiday. Chavez blamed Columbus for leading the way in the mass genocide of the Native Americans by the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3184668.stm |title=Columbus 'sparked a genocide' |accessdate=2006-10-21 |date=2003-10-12 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical appearance==

Although an abundance of artwork involving Christopher Columbus exists, no [[authentic]] contemporary [[portrait]] has been found. There is a portrait painted by [[Alejo Fernández]], between 1505 and 1536, titled [[Virgen de los Navegantes]] in the Royal Alcazar in Seville. At the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]], 71 alleged portraits of Columbus were displayed, most did not match contemporary descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, Samuel Eliot ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', pg. 47-48, Boston 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; These writings describe him as having reddish hair, which turned to white early in his life, light colored eyes,&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomé de Las Casas, ''Historia de las Indias'', ed. Agustín Millares Carlo, 3 vols. (Mexico City, 1951), book 1, chapter 2, 1:29. ''The Spanish word garzos is now usually translated as &quot;light blue,&quot; but it seems to have connoted light grey-green or hazel eyes to Columbus's contemporaries. The word rubio can mean &quot;blonde,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;ruddy.&quot; The Worlds of Christopher Columbus'' by William D. &amp; Carla Rahn Phillips, pg. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being a lighter skinned person with too much sun exposure turning his face red. 

In keeping with descriptions of Columbus having had auburn hair or (later) white hair, textbooks use the Sebastiano del Piombo painting (which in its normal-sized resolution shows Columbus's hair as auburn) so often that it has become the iconic image of Columbus accepted by [[popular culture]].

==In popular culture==
Colombus is a significant historical figure and has been depicted in fiction and in popular films and television.  

In 1991, author [[Salman Rushdie]] published a fictional representation of Columbus in [[The New Yorker]], &quot;Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella of Spain Consummate Their Relationship, Santa Fe, January, 1492,&quot; (The New Yorker, June 17, 1991, p. 32).  In [[Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus]] (1996) [[science fiction]] novelist [[Orson Scott Card]] focuses on Columbus' life and activities, but the novel's action also deals with a group of scientists from the future who travel back to the 15th century with the goal of changing the pattern of European contact with the [[Americas]].  British author [[Stephen Baxter]] includes Columbus' quest for royal sponsorship as a crucial historical event in his 2007 science fiction novel ''Navigator'' (ISBN 978-0-441-01559-7), the third entry in the author's ''Time's Tapestry Series''. American author [[Mark Twain]] based the time traveller's trick in [[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]] on Columbus's sucessful prediction of a lunar eclipse on his fourth voyage to the new world.
 
Columbus has also been portrayed in cinema and television, including mini-series, films and cartoons.  Most notably he was portrayed by [[Gérard Depardieu]] in 1992 film by [[Ridley Scott]] ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]''.  Scott presented Columbus as an idealist as opposed to the view that he was ruthless and responsible for the misfortune of Native Americans. As in many of Scott's movies, the character is presented as having some ideas that weren't current at his time. 

Other more recent productions include TV [[mini-series]] ''[[Christopher Columbus (TV series)|Christopher Columbus]]'' (1985) with [[Gabriel Byrne]] as Colombus, ''[[Christopher Columbus: The Discovery]]'', a 1992 [[biopic]] film by [[Alexander Salkind]], ''[[Christopher Columbus (film)|Christopher Columbus]]'', a 1949 film starring [[Fredric March]] as Columbus, and [[comedy]] ''[[Carry On Columbus]]'' (1992).

As a freshman, he spent the baseball season on the [[junior varsity team|JV]] team. The next three years—1980 to 1982—he starred on the [[varsity team]]. He batted for a .467&amp;nbsp;[[batting average]] his senior year, and was honored as a prep [[All-America]]n.&lt;ref name=MLB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barrybonds.mlb.com/team/player_career.jsp?player_id=111188|accessdate=2007-09-08|date=2007|title=Player Profile: Barry Bonds 25|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Giants drafted Bonds in the second round of the 1982 [[Major League Baseball Draft|MLB draft]] as a high school senior,&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt; but the Giants and Bonds were unable to agree on contract terms, so Bonds instead decided to attend college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Bonds/Bonds_bio.html|accessdate=2007-09-25|title=Barry Bonds: Bio|publisher=Black Book Partners, LLC.|work=jockbio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonds attended [[Arizona State University]], hitting .347 with 45&amp;nbsp;home runs and 175&amp;nbsp;[[runs batted in]] (RBI).&lt;ref name=MLB/&gt; In 1984 he batted .360 and had 30&amp;nbsp;[[stolen base]]s.

==Major league career==
===Pittsburgh Pirates (1986&amp;ndash;92)===
Bonds was drafted by the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the first round (6th overall) of the {{by|1985}} [[Major League Baseball draft]].&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt; Bonds joined the [[Potomac Nationals|Prince William Pirates]] of the [[Carolina League]] and was named July 1985 Player of the Month for the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barrybonds.mlb.com/team/player_career.jsp?player_id=111188&amp;y=1985|accessdate=2007-09-08|date=2007|title=Player Profile: Barry Bonds 25 (1985)|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In {{by|1986}}, he hit .311 in 44 games for the [[Hawaii Islanders]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/B/barry-bonds.shtml|title=Barry Bonds|accessdate=2007-09-08|publisher=thebaseballcube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he made his major league debut on May 30.&lt;ref name=mlb86&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barrybonds.mlb.com/team/player_career.jsp?player_id=111188&amp;y=1986|accessdate=2007-09-08|date=2007|title=Player Profile: Barry Bonds 25 (1986)|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Bonds led [[National League]] (NL) rookies with 16&amp;nbsp;home runs, 48&amp;nbsp;RBI, 36&amp;nbsp;stolen bases and 65&amp;nbsp;walks, but he finished 6th in Rookie of the Year voting.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;&lt;ref name=mlb86/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1986.shtml#NLroy|title=1986 National League Rookie of the Year Award |accessdate=2008-04-16|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|work=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He hit 25&amp;nbsp;home runs in his second season, along with 32&amp;nbsp;stolen bases and 59&amp;nbsp;RBIs.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;  Bonds improved in 1988, hitting .283 with 24&amp;nbsp;home runs.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;  Bonds finished with 19&amp;nbsp;homers, 58&amp;nbsp;RBIs, and 14&amp;nbsp;outfield [[Assist (baseball)|assists]], which was 2nd in NL.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;&lt;ref name=mlb89&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barrybonds.mlb.com/team/player_career.jsp?player_id=111188&amp;y=1989|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=2007|title=Player Profile: Barry Bonds 25 (1989)|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Pittsburgh was defeated by the Braves in a seven-game [[1992 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]]. Bonds was involved in the final play of Game 7 of the NLCS, where he fielded a base hit by [[Francisco Cabrera]] and attempted to throw out [[Sid Bream]] at home plate. But the throw to Pirates catcher [[Mike LaValliere]] was late and Bream scored the winning run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/baseballs_best/mlb_bb_gamepage.jsp?story_page=bb_92nlcs_gm7_pitatl|title=Sid Bream's modern-day &quot;mad dash&quot; wins the pennant for Atlanta|accessdate=2007-09-08|date=[[1992-10-14]]|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the third consecutive season, the NL East Champion Pirates were denied a trip to the World Series.

===San Francisco Giants (1993&amp;ndash;2007)===
[[Image:Barrybonds1.JPG|right|thumb|Bonds in the field.]]
In 1993, Bonds left the Pirates to sign a lucrative [[free agent]] contract worth a then-record $43.75 million over 6 years with the Giants, with whom his father spent the first 7 years of his career, and with whom his godfather [[Willie Mays]] played 22 of his 24 Major League seasons. The deal was at that time the largest in baseball history, in terms of both total value and average annual salary.&lt;ref name=43million&gt;Chass, Murray. &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFDD1F38F935A35751C1A964958260 Giants Make Investment: $43 Million in Bonds]&quot;, [[The New York Times]], published December 6, 1992, accessed January 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; To honor his father, Bonds switched his jersey number to 25 once he signed with the Giants, as it had been Bobby's number in San Francisco. (His number during most of his stay with the Pirates, 24, was retired in honor of Mays anyway).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QIv7agRgVjEC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=%22bobby+bonds%22+%22number+25%22+barry&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ZhHQPVP-52&amp;sig=2uomExw01lPXMPJDWFwd06uE4kY&amp;hl=en|title=Love Me, Hate Me: Barry Bonds and the Making of an Antihero|accessdate=2008-04-17|publisher=[[Google Book Search]]|author=Pearlman, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonds hit .336 in 1993, leading the league with 46 home runs and 123 RBI en route to his second consecutive MVP award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1993.shtml#NLmvp|title=1993 National League Most Valuable Player Award |accessdate=2008-04-16|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|work=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and third overall. As good as the Giants were (winning 103 games), the [[Atlanta Braves]] won 104 in what some call the last great pennant race (due to the Wild Card being instituted shortly after).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/2001/0927/1255891.html|work=ESPN Classic|title=What makes a great Pennant Race?|accessdate=2007-09-25|date=[[2001-10-01]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|author=Neyer, Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{by|1996}}, Bonds became the first National League player and second (of the current list of four) major league player(s) to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in the same season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barrybonds.mlb.com/team/player_career.jsp?player_id=111188&amp;y=1996|accessdate=2008-04-17|date=2007|title=Player Profile: Barry Bonds 25 (1996)|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other members of the [[40-40 club]] are [[José Canseco]]—1988, [[Alex Rodriguez]]—1998, and [[Alfonso Soriano]]—2006; his father Bobby Bonds was one home run short in 1973 when he hit 39 home runs and stole 43 bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/16/AR2006091600674.html|title=Soriano Reaches 40-40 Mark|accessdate=2008-04-17|date=[[2006-09-17]]|author=Goff, Steven|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bonds drove in 129 runs with a .308 average and walked a then-National League record 151 times.

In {{by|1998}}, he hit .303 with 37 home runs and drove in 122 runs, winning his eighth Gold Glove,&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt; and became the first player ever to enter the [[400-400 club]] by having career totals of 400 home runs and 400 stolen bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/sf/history/sf_history_timeline_article.jsp?article=35|title=1996: Bonds bashes, runs into history|accessdate=2008-04-17|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.|work=Giants Timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With two outs in the 9th inning of a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 28, 1998, Bonds became only the fifth player in baseball history to be given an [[intentional walk]] with the bases loaded.

[[Image:BarryLamar Bonds.jpg|thumb|left|Bonds at the plate with the Giants.]]

In 2000, the following year, Bonds hit .306 with a slugging percentage of .688 (career best at that time) and hit 49 home runs in just 143 games (also a career high to that point), while drawing a league-leading 117 walks.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;

In the Giants' first 50 games in 2001, Bonds hit 28 home runs, including 17 in May—a career high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/bondstracker/bondslog|title=Bonds Career HR Log|accessdate=2007-09-25|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|work=CBS Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also hit 39 home runs by the All-star break (a major league record), drew a major league record 177 walks, and had a .515 on-base average, a feat not seen since Mickey Mantle and Ted Williams over forty years earlier. Bonds' slugging percentage was a major league record .863&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Guinness World Records |page=p. 232 |year=2007 |publisher=[[HiT Entertainment]] |location=London; New York City |isbn=9780973551440}}&lt;/ref&gt; (411 total bases in 476 at-bats), and, most impressively, he ended the season with [[List of Barry Bonds 73 Home Runs|a major league record 73 home runs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barrybonds.mlb.com/team/player_career.jsp?player_id=111188&amp;y=2001|accessdate=2008-04-17|date=2007|title=Player Profile: Barry Bonds 25 (2001)|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bonds re-signed with the Giants for a five-year, $90 million contract in January 2002. That year, he hit 46 home runs in 403 at-bats.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt; He won the NL batting title with a career-high .370 average and struck out only 47 times. Despite playing in nine fewer games than the previous season, he drew 198 walks, a major-league record, 68 of them intentional. He slugged .799, then the fourth-highest total all time. Bonds broke Ted Williams' major league record for on-base average with .582. Bonds also hit his 600th home run, less than a year and a half after hitting his 500th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barrybonds.mlb.com/team/player_career.jsp?player_id=111188&amp;y=2002|accessdate=2008-04-17|date=2007|title=Player Profile: Barry Bonds 25 (2002)|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2003, Bonds played in just 130 games. He hit 45 home runs in just 390 at-bats, along with a .341 batting average. He slugged .749, walked 148 times, and had an on-base average well over .500 (.529) for the third straight year.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt; He also became the only member of the career 500 home run/500 stolen base club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=230623126|title=Bonds' big night steals win for Giants|accessdate=2008-04-17|date=[[2003-06-23]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Bonds had perhaps his best season. He hit .362 en route to his second National League batting title, and broke his own record by walking 232 times. He slugged .812, which was fourth-highest of all time, and broke his on-base percentage record with a .609 average. Bonds passed Mays on the career home run list, hitting his 700th near the end of the season. Bonds hit 45 home runs in 373 at-bats, and struck out just 41 times, putting himself in elite company, as few major leaguers have ever had more home runs than strikeouts in a season. Bonds would win his fourth consecutive MVP award and his seventh overall.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barrybonds.mlb.com/team/player_career.jsp?player_id=111188&amp;y=2004|accessdate=2008-04-17|date=2007|title=Player Profile: Barry Bonds 25 (2004)|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His seven MVP awards are four more than any other player in history.

On July 4, 2004 he tied and passed [[Rickey Henderson]]'s career bases on balls record with his 2190th and 2191st career walks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=240704126|accessdate=2007-07-19|date=[[2004-07-04]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|title=Bradford, Mulder both walk slugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron was called on for his opinion of Bonds. He clarified that he was a fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk due Bonds' to alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E3DB1738F934A35757C0A9629C8B63|title= Sports of The Times; Aaron Will Let the Fans Judge Bonds|accessdate=2008-05-27|date=[[2004-04-07]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Anderson, Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with Pete Rose could be emphasized less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1939208|title=HOF and asterisks not up to Aaron|accessdate=2008-05-27|date=[[2004-12-06]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2879440|title=If Bonds breaks HR record, Aaron 'won't be there'|accessdate=2008-05-27|date=[[2007-05-22]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media when Bonds broke Aaron's record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2007-08-08-bonds-756_N.htm|title=Bonds blasts No. 756 to take over top spot|accessdate=2008-05-27|date=[[2007-08-07]]|publisher=[[USA TODAY]]|author=Nightengale, Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonds' salary for the 2005 season was $22 million, the second-highest salary in Major League Baseball (the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]]' [[Alex Rodriguez]] earned the highest, $25.2 million).&lt;ref name=BRSalaries&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/leaders_salaries.shtml|title=Highest Career Total and Single-Season Salaries|accessdate=2007-09-29|publisher=Sports Reference, Inc.|date=[[2007-09-27]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bonds endured a knee injury, multiple surgeries, and rehabilitation. He was activated on September 12, 2005, and started in left field. In his return against the [[San Diego Padres]], he nearly hit a home run in his first at-bat. Bonds finished the night 1-for-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=250912126|title=Giant comeback: Bonds 1-for-4 in winning return|accessdate=2008-04-17|date=[[2005-09-12]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, Bonds resumed his high-caliber performance at the plate, hitting home runs in four consecutive games from September 18, 2005 to September 21, 2005 and finishing with five homers in only 14 games.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;

====2006 season====
[[Image:Barry Bonds3.jpg|thumb|Bonds batting against the Chicago Cubs in 2006]]
In 2006, Bonds earned $20 million (not including bonuses), the fourth highest salary in baseball. Through the 2006 season he had earned approximately $172 million during his then 21-year career, making him baseball's all-time highest paid player.&lt;ref name=BRSalaries/&gt;
Bonds hit under .200 for his first 10 games of the season and did not hit a home run until April 22, 2006. This 10-game stretch was his longest home run slump since the 1998 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260422127|title=Bonds goes opposite field for career No. 709|accessdate=2008-04-17|date=[[2006-04-22]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 7, 2006, Bonds drew within one home run of tying Babe Ruth for second place on the all time list, hitting his 713th career home run into the second level of [[Citizens Bank Park]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], off pitcher [[Jon Lieber]] in an [[ESPN]] nationally-televised game in which the Giants lost to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260507122|accessdate=2007-07-02|date=[[2006-05-07]]|title=Amidst Bonds spectacle, Phillies win eighth straight|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The towering home run—one of the longest in Citizens Bank Park's two-season history, traveling an estimated 450&amp;nbsp;feet (140&amp;nbsp;m)—hit off the facade of the third deck in right field.

Then, on May 20, 2006, Bonds tied Ruth, hitting his 714th career home run to deep right field to lead off the top of the 2nd inning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260520111|accessdate=2007-07-02|date=[[2006-05-20]]|title=Bonds reels in Babe, blasts home run No. 714|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The home run came off left-handed pitcher [[Brad Halsey]] of the [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland A's]], in an [[Interleague play|interleague]] game played in [[Oakland, California]]. Since this was an interleague game at an American League stadium, Bonds was batting as the [[designated hitter]] in the lineup for the Giants. Bonds was quoted after the game as being &quot;glad it's over with&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barrybonds.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060501&amp;content_id=1427974&amp;vkey=news_sf&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=sf |title=Bonds ties Ruth with homer No. 714|date=[[2006-05-20]]||publisher=MLB Advanced MediaZ|accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that more attention could be focused on [[Albert Pujols]], who was on a very rapid home run pace in early 2006.

On May 28, 2006, Bonds passed Ruth, hitting his 715th career home run to center field off [[Colorado Rockies]] pitcher [[Byung-Hyun Kim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260528126|accessdate=2007-07-02|date=[[2006-05-28]]|title=Bonds' milestone homer not enough vs. Rockies|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/gamecenter/recap/MLB_20060528_COL@SF|accessdate=2007-09-29|date=[[2006-05-28]]|title=Bonds hits No. 715, passes Ruth as Giants fall to Rockies|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|author=Miller, Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ball was hit an estimated 445&amp;nbsp;feet (140&amp;nbsp;m) into center field where it went through the hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform in center field. Then it rolled off the platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball while he was in line at a concession stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/05/29/MNG17J42R61.DTL|title=THE BALL:He went for peanuts, and came back with a chance for a fortune|accessdate=2008-04-17|date=[[2006-05-29]]|author=Estrella, Cicero A., and Tanya Schevitz|publisher=[[Hearst Communications Inc.]]|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mysteriously, radio broadcaster [[Dave Flemming]]'s radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But the televised version, called by Giants broadcaster [[Duane Kuiper]], was not affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2461761|accessdate=2008-04-18|date=[[2006-05-29]]|title=Giants' radio call cuts out just as Bonds hits No. 715|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 2006, Bonds tied Henry Aaron's National League career home run record of 733. The home run came in the top of the 6th inning of a high-scoring game against the Milwaukee Brewers, at [[Miller Park]] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The achievement was notable for its occurrence in the very city where Aaron began (with the Milwaukee Braves) and concluded (with the Brewers, then in the American League) his career. With the Giants trailing 10&amp;ndash;8, Bonds hit a blast to deep center field on a 2&amp;ndash;0 pitch off the Brewers' [[Chris Spurling]] with runners on first and second and one out. Though the Giants were at the time clinging to only a slim chance of making the playoffs, Bonds' home run provided the additional drama of giving the Giants an 11&amp;ndash;10 lead late in a critical game in the final days of a pennant race. The Brewers eventually won the game, 13&amp;ndash;12, despite Bonds' going 3 for 5, with 2 doubles, the record-tying home run, and 6 runs batted in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260922108|accessdate=2007-07-02|date=[[2006-09-22]]|title=Bonds ties Aaron's NL HR mark, but Giants fall to Brewers|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the following day, September 23, 2006, Bonds surpassed Aaron for the NL career home run record. Hit in Milwaukee like the previous one, this was a solo home run off [[Chris Capuano]] of the Brewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260923108|accessdate=2007-07-02|date=[[2006-09-23]]|title=Bonds hits NL-record 734th HR, but Giants lose again|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the last home run Bonds hit in 2006. In 2006, Bonds recorded his lowest [[slugging percentage]] (a statistic that he has historically ranked among league leaders season after season) since 1991 with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;

In January 2007, the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' reported that Bonds had tested positive for [[amphetamine]]s.&lt;ref name=NYP011107&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/01112007/sports/report__bonds_used_speed_sports_.htm|accessdate=2007-09-04|title=Report: Bonds used 'speed'|date=[[2007-01-11]]|work=New York Post|publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under baseball's amphetamine policy, which had been in effect for one season, players testing positive were to submit to six additional tests and undergo treatment and counseling.&lt;ref name=NYP011107/&gt; The policy also stated that players were not to be identified for a first positive test, but the ''New York Daily News'' leaked the test's results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2727325|accessdate=2007-09-04|date=[[2007-01-11]]|title=Report: Bonds failed amphetamine test|author=|work=ESPN.com MLB news|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the Players Association informed Bonds of the test results, he initially attributed it to a substance he had taken from the locker of Giants teammate [[Mark Sweeney]],&lt;ref name=NYP011107/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/baseball/mlb/01/11/bonds.amphetamines/index.html|accessdate=2007-09-04|date=[[2007-01-11]]|title=Caught in the act|author=Quinn, T.J.|work=SI.com|publisher=Time Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but would later retract this claim and publicly apologize to Sweeney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2007/02/20/SPGV7O7HBH1.DTL|accessdate=2007-09-04|date=[[2007-02-20]]|title=Sweeney: It's 'over and done': Giants don't expect another apology from Bonds|author=Schulman, Henry|work=San Francisco Chronicle|publisher=Hearst Communications Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2007 season====
[[Image:Barrybonds2.JPG|thumb|right|Bonds at the plate against the Rockies in 2007]]
On January 29, 2007, the Giants finalized a contract with Bonds for the 2007 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070129&amp;content_id=1789025&amp;vkey=news_sf&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=sf|title=Bonds, Giants agree to deal|date=[[2007-01-29]]|accessdate=2007-09-25|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.|work=MLB.com|author=Bloom, Barry M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the commissioner's office rejected Bonds's one-year, $15.8 million deal because it contained a personal-appearance provision, the team sent revised documents to his agent, Jeff Borris, who stated that &quot;At this time, Barry is not signing the new documents.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20070201/ai_n18626981 |title=Agent: Bonds won't sign revised contract right now|date=[[2007-02-01]]|accessdate=2007-09-25|publisher=FindArticles|work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bonds signed a revised one-year, $15.8 million contract on February 15, 2007, and reported to the Giants' Spring Training camp on time.

Bonds resumed his march to the all-time record early in the 2007 season. After an opening game in which all he had was a first-inning single past third base against a right-shifted infield (immediately followed by a stolen base and then a base-running misjudgment that got him thrown out at home) and a deep out to left field late in the game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap?gid=270403126|title=San Diego 7, San Francisco 0 (recap)|accessdate=2007-04-14|publisher=Yahoo!

In his first at-bat of the season's second game at the Giants' AT&amp;T Park, Bonds hit a [[Chris Young (baseball pitcher)|Chris Young]] (of the San Diego Padres) pitch just over the wall to the left of straightaway center field for career home run 735.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap?gid=270404126|title=San Diego 5, San Francisco 3 (recap)|accessdate=2007-04-14|publisher=Yahoo!

Bonds did not homer again until April 13, 2007 when he hit two (736 and 737) in a 3 for 3 night that included 4 RBI against the Pittsburgh Pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap?gid=270413123&amp;prov=ap|title=San Francisco 8, Pittsburgh 5 (recap)|accessdate=2007-04-14|publisher=Yahoo!

The hype surrounding Bonds' pursuit of the home run record escalated on May 14, 2007. On this day, Sports Auction for Heritage (a Dallas-based auction house) offered US$1 million to the fan that caught Bonds' record-breaking 756th-career home run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2869244|accessdate=2007-06-30|date=[[2007-05-14]]|title=Auction house willing to buy 756 ball for $1M|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The million dollar offer was rescinded on June 11, 2007 out of concern of fan safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2900735|accessdate=2007-06-30|date=[[2007-06-12]]|title=Auction house withdraws $1M bounty on No. 756|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that same day, Bonds launched home run 747, ending the relative drought of the previous month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=270611126|accessdate=2007-06-30|date=[[2007-06-11]]|title=Bonds' two-run shot helps Giants rally back vs. Jays|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This one came off Josh Towers of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], and landed in [[AT&amp;T Park]]'s right center field stands. His next home run, 748, came on Father's Day, June 17, 2007, in the final game of a 3-game road series against the Boston Red Sox at [[Fenway Park]], where Bonds had never previously played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=270617102|accessdate=2007-06-30|date=[[2007-06-17]]|title=Bonds hits first Fenway homer in loss to Red Sox|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With this homer, Fenway Park became the 36th major league ballpark in which Bonds had hit a home run. He hit a [[Tim Wakefield]] knuckleball just over the low fence into the Giant's bullpen in right field. It was his first home run off his former Pittsburgh Pirate teammate, who became the 441st different pitcher to surrender a four-bagger to Bonds. The 750th career home run, hit on June 29, 2007, also came off a former teammate: [[Liván Hernández]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=270629126|accessdate=2007-06-30|date=[[2007-06-29]]|title=Bonds is 5 homers shy of Aaron's mark after loss in 10th|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The blast came in the 8th inning and at that point tied the game at 3&amp;ndash;3.

On July 19, 2007, after a 21 at-bat hitless streak, Bonds hit 2 home runs, numbers 752 and 753 against the [[Chicago Cubs]]. He went 3–3 with 2 home runs, 6 RBIs, and a walk on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap?gid=270719116|title=Chi Cubs 9, San Francisco 8 (recap)|accessdate=2007-07-19|publisher=Yahoo!

On July 27, 2007, Bonds hit home run 754 against [[Florida Marlins]] pitcher [[Rick VandenHurk]]. Bonds was then walked his next 4 at bats in the game, but 2-run shot helped the Giants win the game 12&amp;ndash;10. It marked the first game Bonds had homered in that the Giants won since he had hit #747.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=270727126|accessdate=2007-09-08|date=[[2007-07-27]]|title=Bonds pulls within one of Aaron's all-time mark with 754th career homer|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 4, 2007, Bonds hit a &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;382&amp;nbsp;foot&amp;nbsp;(116&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;/span&gt; home run against [[Clay Hensley]] of the [[San Diego Padres]] for home run number 755, tying Hank Aaron's all-time record.&lt;ref name=ESPN20070804&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=270804125|accessdate=2007-09-08|date=[[2007-08-04]]|title=Bonds ties Aaron with No. 755, but Pads win in 12|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bonds greeted his son, Nikolai, with an extended bear hug after crossing home plate. Bonds greeted his teammates and then his wife, Liz Watson, and daughter Aisha Lynn behind the backstop. Hensley was the 445th different pitcher to give up a home run to Bonds.&lt;ref name=ESPN20070804/&gt; Ironically, given the cloud of suspicion that surrounded Bonds, the tying home run was hit off a pitcher who'd been suspended by baseball in 2005 for steroid use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/padres/20050405-9999-1s5padside.html SignOnSanDiego.com &gt; San Diego Padres - Steroids violators in minors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was walked in his next at bat and eventually scored on a fielder's choice.

On August 7, 2007 at 8:51&amp;nbsp;PM [[Pacific time zone|PDT]], Bonds hit a &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;435&amp;nbsp;foot&amp;nbsp;(133&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;/span&gt; home run, his 756th, off a pitch from [[Mike Bacsik (left-handed pitcher)|Mike Bacsik]] of the [[Washington Nationals]], breaking the all-time career home run record, formerly held by [[Hank Aaron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=270807126|accessdate=2007-09-08|date=[[2007-08-07]]|title=Bonds turns page to new era with home run No. 756|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, Bacsik's father had faced Aaron (as a pitcher for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]) after Aaron had hit his 755th home run.  On August 23, 1976, Michael J. Bacsik held Aaron to a single and a fly out to right field.

The pitch, the seventh of the at-bat, was a 3–2 pitch which Bonds hit into the right-center field bleachers. The fan who ended up with the ball, 22-year-old Matt Murphy from [[Queens]], [[New York]] (and a [[New York Mets|Met fan]]), was promptly protected and escorted away from the mayhem by a group of San Francisco police officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2965703|title=Queens man in San Francisco for one day catches famous ball|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=2007-09-29|date=[[2007-08-09]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Bonds finished his home run trot, a ten-minute delay followed, including a brief video by Aaron congratulating Bonds on breaking the record Aaron had held for 33 years,&lt;ref name=&quot;too good to be true&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Kriegel, Mark|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/7102950|title=Bonds' historic journey too good to be true|publisher=Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.|accessdate=2007-09-29|date=[[2007-08-08]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expressing the hope that &quot;the achievement of this record will inspire others to chase their own dreams.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;too good to be true&quot;/&gt; Bonds made an impromptu emotional statement on the field, with Willie Mays, his godfather, at his side and thanked his teammates, family and his late father.&lt;ref name=&quot;too good to be true&quot;/&gt; Bonds sat out the rest of the game and was replaced in left field.

The commissioner, [[Bud Selig]], was not in attendance in this game but was represented by the Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations, [[Jimmie Lee Solomon]].

Speeches were made by Willie Mays, Giants teammates [[Omar Vizquel]] and [[Rich Aurilia]], and Giants owner [[Peter Magowan]]. Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] presented Bonds the key to the [[San Francisco, California|City and County of San Francisco]] and Giants vice president Larry Baer gave Bonds the home plate he touched after hitting his 756th career home run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wildermuth, John|title=San Francisco honors Barry Bonds for Giant accomplishments|publisher=Hearst Communications Inc.|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=[[2007-08-25]]|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/08/25/BAALRP1IQ.DTL|accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Padnos, who submitted the (US) $186,750 winning bid on Bonds' record-tying 755th home run ball also set up a website to let fans decide its fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ap-bonds-756ball&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns|title=Barry Bonds' No. 756 to be branded with an asterisk and sent to Baseball Hall of Fame|publisher=Yahoo!/The Associated Press|accessdate=2007-10-04|date=2007-09-26|author=Freeman, Rick}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of Ecko's plans, Bonds said &quot;He spent $750,000 on the ball and that's what he's doing with it?

Bonds concluded the 2007 season with a .276 batting average, 28 home runs, and 66 RBIs in 126 games and 340 at bats. At the age of 43, he led both leagues in walks with 132.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;

===2008 season===
On September 21, 2007, the San Francisco Giants confirmed that they would not re-sign Bonds for the 2008 season.&lt;ref name=BwrwGf0tc/&gt; The story was first announced on Bonds' own web site earlier that day.&lt;ref name=WdBBgfh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=txbondswherenext&amp;prov=st&amp;type=lgns|title=Where does Barry Bonds go from here?|date=[[2007-09-21]]|accessdate=2007-09-24|publisher=Yahoo!|author=Covill, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; He filed for [[Free agent|free agency]] on October 29, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071029&amp;content_id=2287536&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|accessdate=2007-10-29|title=Bonds files for free agency|publisher=Major League Baseball|date=[[2007-10-29]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was much speculation about where Bonds might play in 2008 and possibly beyond. During the offseason, experts suggested nearly a dozen teams as possible destinations.&lt;ref name=Bhfcfnti0&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news;_ylt=AspY18TWvLzhtF4P5Uz1KOSFCLcF?slug=bondshasfewchoicesfornew&amp;prov=tsn&amp;type=lgns|title=Bonds has few choices for new team in '08|author=McNeal, Stan|publisher=Yahoo!

In addition to the hits, Bonds needs 69 more [[runs scored]] to move past [[Rickey Henderson]] as the all-time runs champion. He needs 38 [[extra base hit]]s to move past [[Hank Aaron]] as the all-time extra base hits champion. Bonds also continues to talk of his quest for a [[World Series]] championship as motivation for returning.&lt;ref name=BwrwGf0tc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3030852|title=Bonds won't return with Giants for '08, team confirms|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=[[2007-09-22]]|accessdate=2007-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since filing for free agency, Bonds has said he is ready to play and would like to be signed. During the 2008 season, teams said to have been contemplating signing Bonds include the [[Detroit Tigers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/13/SPOI103O8N.DTL|title=TIGERS BY THE TAIL: No panic yet in front office - or thoughts of adding Bonds|accessdate=2008-08-04|work=2008-04-13|publisher=[[Hearst Communications Inc.]]|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Shea, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Boston Red Sox]],&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.aol.com/fanhouse/2008/06/04/should-the-red-sox-sign-barry-bonds-to-replace-david-ortiz/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[New York Yankees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/baseball/mlb/07/25/heyman.bonds/index.html|title=Yankees haven't ruled out Bonds|accessdate=2008-08-04|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[SI.com]]|author=Heyman, Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of early September 2008 he had not yet been signed.

==Controversies==
===BALCO Scandal===
In 2003, Bonds became embroiled in a scandal when [[Greg Anderson (trainer)|Greg Anderson]] of the [[BALCO|Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative]] (henceforth BALCO), Bonds' trainer since 2000, was indicted by a federal [[grand jury]] in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] and charged with supplying [[anabolic steroids]] to athletes, including a number of baseball players. This led to speculation that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs during a time when there was no mandatory testing in Major League Baseball. Bonds declared his innocence, attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of bodybuilding, diet and legitimate supplements.&lt;ref name=Bttsdw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1937594|title=Bonds testified that substances didn't work|accessdate=2008-02-20|date=[[2004-12-04]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

During grand jury testimony on December 4, 2003—which was later found to be obtained through an illegal leak by Troy Ellerman,&lt;ref name=BlEg2yip/&gt; a defense lawyer for [[Victor Conte]], to the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' (leaking grand jury testimony is a felony, to which Ellerman pled guilty to on February 14, 2007) and published almost a year later, on December 3, 2004—
Bonds said that he used a clear substance and a cream that he received from his personal strength trainer, Greg Anderson, who told him they were the nutritional supplement flaxseed oil and a rubbing balm for arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/12/03/MNGGFA0UDU65.DTL|title=What Bonds told BALCO grand jury|date=[[2004-12-03]]|accessdate=2007-10-10|publisher=Hearst Communications Inc.|work=San Francisco Chronicle|author=Williams, Lance, Mark Fainaru-Wada}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This testimony, as reported by [[Lance Williams]] and [[Mark Fainaru-Wada]], has frequently been misrepresented.  Later reports on Bonds's leaked grand-jury testimony contend that he admitted to unknowingly using &quot;[[the cream]]&quot; and &quot;[[Tetrahydrogestrinone|the clear]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bttsdw/&gt;

In July 2005, all four defendants in the BALCO steroid scandal trial, including Anderson, struck deals with federal prosecutors that did not require them to reveal names of athletes who may have used banned drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/07/16/MNG7PDP6HA1.DTL | title=40 of 42 BALCO charges dropped - Steroid lab owner, Bonds' trainer guilty in plea deal | publisher=[[Hearst Communications Inc.]]|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=[[2005-07-16]] | accessdate=2008-02-20 |author=Fainaru-Wada, Mark and Lance Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Players' Union===
Bonds withdrew from the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|MLB Players Association]]'s (MLBPA) [[License|licensing]] agreement because he felt independent marketing deals would be more lucrative for him. Bonds is the first player in the thirty-year history of the licensing program not to sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1661883|title=Bonds will be individually licensed|accessdate=2008-02-20|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=[[2003-11-17]]|author=Rovell, Darren}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this withdrawal, his name and likeness are not usable in any merchandise licensed by the MLBPA. In order to use his name or likeness, a company must deal directly with Bonds.  For this reason he does not appear in some baseball [[video games]], forcing game-makers to create generic athletes to replace him. For example, Bonds is replaced by &quot;[[Jon Dowd]]&quot; in ''[[MVP Baseball 2005]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewiire.com/review/135/1/The_BIGS|title=The BIGS|accessdate=2008-02-20|publisher=The Wiire|author=Wright, Eric|date=[[2007-07-24]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Unable to find refs &quot;Wes Mailman&quot; in ''[[All-Star Baseball 2005]]'', &quot;Joe Young&quot; in [[MLB 2K7]], Backyard Baseball 2007 and &quot;Dean Gibeau&quot; in ''All-Star Baseball 2006 ''and &quot;Reggie Stocker&quot; in ''[[MLB 07: The Show]]''. Also, [[Strat-o-Matic]] baseball publishes a card with no name, but abilities based on Bonds' statistics.--&gt;

===''Game of Shadows''===
{{main|Game of Shadows}}
[[Image:Barry Bonds SI Cover.jpg|thumb|Barry Bonds on the March 13, 2006 cover of Sports Illustrated heralding the release of ''[[Game of Shadows]]'']]
In March, 2006 the book ''[[Game of Shadows]]'', written by [[Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada]], was released amid a storm of media publicity including the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/2006/0313.html|title=SI Cover Search|accessdate=2008-02-20|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[SI.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially small excerpts of the book were released by the authors in the issue of ''Sports Illustrated''. The book alleges Bonds used [[stanozolol]] and a host of other steroids, and is perhaps most responsible for the change in public opinion regarding Bonds' steroid use.&lt;ref name=TTABBaS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/magazine/03/06/growth0313/|title=The Truth About Barry Bonds and Steroids|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[SI.com]]|accessdate=2008-02-20|author=Fainaru-Wada, Mark and Lance Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/23/books/23kaku.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title=Barry Bonds and Baseball's Steroids Scandal|accessdate=2008-02-20|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|date=[[2006-03-23]]|author=Kakutani, Michiko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book contained excerpts of grand jury testimony that is supposed to be sealed and confidential by law. The authors have been steadfast in their refusal to divulge their sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=2435256|title='Game of Shadows' authors are subpoenaed|accessdate=2008-02-20|date=[[2006-05-06]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at one point faced jail time. On February 14, 2007, Troy Ellerman, one of [[Victor Conte]]'s lawyers, pled guilty to leaking grand jury testimony. Through the plea agreement, he will spend two and a half years in jail.&lt;ref name=BlEg2yip&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2934650|title=BALCO leaker Ellerman gets 2½ years in prison|accessdate=2008-02-20|date=[[2007-07-12]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Love Me, Hate Me''===
In May 2006, former ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer [[Jeff Pearlman]] released a scathing biography of Bonds entitled ''Love Me, Hate Me: Barry Bonds and the Making of an Anti-Hero.'' The book also contained many allegations against Bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06099/680058-148.stm|title='Love Me, Hate Me: Barry Bonds and the Making of an Antihero' by Jeff Pearlman|accessdate=2008-02-20|publisher=PG Publishing Co., Inc.|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=[[2006-04-09]]|author=Caroulis, Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book, which describes Bonds as a polarizing insufferable braggart with a legendary ego and staggering ability, relied on over five hundred interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061191923/Love_Me_Hate_Me/index.aspx|title=Love Me, Hate Me|accessdate=2008-02-20|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perjury investigation and Federal indictment===
{{main|Legal problems of Barry Bonds}}
On November 15, 2007, Bonds was indicted for both four counts of [[perjury]] and one count of [[obstruction of justice]] as it relates to the government investigation of BALCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7097583.stm|title=Baseball star Barry Bonds charged|work=BBC News|date=2007-11-16|accessdate=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2008 a [[typo]] in court papers filed by Federal prosecutors erroneously alleged that Bonds tested positive for steroids in November, 2001, a month after hitting his record 73rd home run. The reference was meant instead to refer to a November 2000 test that had already been disclosed and previously reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3246675&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines|title=U.S. filing typo spurs erroneous Bonds drug report|author = |work=ESPN.com news services|date=2008-02-15|accessdate=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typo sparked a brief media frenzy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=4294590|title=Typo Spurs Erroneous Bonds Drug Reports|author=Paul Elias |work=ABC News|date=2008-02-15|accessdate=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His trial for obstruction of justice is to begin on March 2, 2009. Mr Bonds is not expected to get prison time should he be convicted after a pro cyclist facing similar charges in the case was given house arrest and probation instead of jail time. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/11/sports/othersports/11doping.html?ref=sports&lt;/ref&gt;

*Through [[2007 Major League Baseball season]]&lt;ref name=br-stats&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/b/bondsba01.shtml |title=Barry Bonds Statistics| work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, Inc.|accessdate=2007-11-03|date=[[2007-10-28]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career distinctions==
Besides holding Major League career records in home runs (762), walks (2,558), and intentional walks (688), Bonds also leads all active players in RBI (1,996), on-base percentage (.444), runs (2,227), games (2,986), extra-base hits (1,440), at-bats per home run (12.92), and total bases (5,976). He is 2nd in doubles (601), slugging percentage (.607), stolen bases (514), at-bats (9,847), and hits (2,935), 6th in triples (77), 8th in sacrifice flies (91), and 9th in [[strikeout]]s (1,539), through September 26, 2007.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;

Bonds is the lone member of the 500–500 club, which means he has hit at least 500 home runs (762) and stolen 500 bases (514). He is also one of only four baseball players all-time to be in the 40–40 club (1996), which means he hit 40 home runs (42) and stole 40 bases (40) in the same season.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Microsoft]], the software company he founded with [[Paul Allen]]. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of [[chief executive officer|CEO]] and [[software architecture|chief software architect]], and remains the largest individual shareholder with more than 8 percent of the [[common stock]].&lt;ref&gt;Gates regularly documents his share ownership through public SEC form 4 filings.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also authored or co-authored several books.

Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the [[personal computer]] revolution. Although he is admired by many, a large number of industry insiders criticize his business tactics, which they consider anti-competitive, an opinion which has in some cases been upheld by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lesinski|2006|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later stages of his career, Gates has pursued a number of [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] endeavors, donating large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], established in 2000.

Bill Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January, 2000. He remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect. In June, 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work at Microsoft and full-time work at the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]. He gradually transferred his duties to [[Ray Ozzie]], [[chief software architect]] and [[Craig Mundie]], chief research and strategy officer. Gates's last full-time day at [[Microsoft]] was June 27, 2008. He remains at Microsoft as a part-time, non-executive chairman.

==Early life==
Gates was born in [[Seattle]], [[Washington]], to [[William H. Gates, Sr.]] and [[Mary Maxwell Gates]]. His family was upper middle class; his father was a prominent lawyer, his mother served on the board of directors for [[First Interstate BancSystem]] and the [[United Way of America|United Way]], and her father, J. W. Maxwell, was a [[National bank#United States|national bank]] president. Gates has one older sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He was the fourth of his name in his family, but was known as William Gates III or &quot;Trey&quot; because his father had dropped his own &quot;III&quot; suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on in his life, Gates's parents had a law career in mind for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At thirteen he enrolled in the [[Lakeside School]], an exclusive preparatory school.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy an [[ASR-33]] [[teletype]] [[computer terminal|terminal]] and a block of computer time on a [[General Electric]] (GE) computer for the school's students.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of [[tic-tac-toe]] that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he commented on it and said, &quot;There was just something neat about the machine.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;dlzsnr&quot;&gt;{{harv|Gates|1996|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] [[minicomputer]]s. One of these systems was a [[PDP-10]] belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students—Gates, [[Paul Allen]], [[Ric Weiland]], and Kent Evans—for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the [[operating system]] to obtain free computer time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for computer time. Rather than use the system via teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied [[source code]] for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in [[FORTRAN]], [[LISP]], and [[machine language]]. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when it went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in [[COBOL]], providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with mostly female students. He later stated that &quot;it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;dlzsnr&quot;/&gt; At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called [[Traf-O-Data]], to make [[traffic counter]]s based on the [[Intel 8008]] processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gates|1996|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates graduated from Lakeside School in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the [[Scholastic Aptitude Test]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lesinski|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently enrolled at [[Harvard College]] in the fall of 1973.&lt;ref name = &quot;wzxoxv&quot;&gt;{{harv|Gates|1996|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the mid 1990s, an SAT score of 1590 was equivalent to an IQ of about 170 (roughly the one in a million level)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/MCReport/mcreport.html&lt;/ref&gt;, a figure that would frequently be cited by the press&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forbes.com/forbes/1997/1013/6008040a_2.html&lt;/ref&gt;. While at Harvard, he met his future business partner, [[Steve Ballmer]], whom he later appointed as CEO of Microsoft. He also met computer scientist [[Christos Papadimitriou]] at Harvard, with whom he collaborated on a paper about algorithms.&lt;ref name=&quot;gatespapadimitriou&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gates | first=William | year=1979 | title=Bounds for sorting by prefix reversal | journal=[[Discrete mathematics]] | volume=27 | pages=47–57 | doi=10.1016/0012-365X(79)90068-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not have a definite study plan while a student at Harvard&lt;ref name = &quot;lmxgxg&quot;&gt;{{harv|Gates|1996|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent a lot of time using the school's computers.

==Microsoft==
{{main|History of Microsoft|Microsoft}}
===BASIC===
[[Image:Altair 8800 Computer.jpg|thumb|200px|right|MITS Altair 8800 Computer with 8 inch floppy disk system]]
After reading the January 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' that demonstrated the [[Altair 8800]], Gates contacted [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems]] (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a [[BASIC]] interpreter for the platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyevents&quot;&gt;{{cite paper | title=Microsoft Visitor Center Student Information: Key Events in Microsoft History | url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc | publisher=[[Microsoft]] | format=.DOC |accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president [[H. Edward Roberts|Ed Roberts]] agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair [[emulator]] that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as [[Altair BASIC]]. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Microsoft history|publisher=The History of Computing Project | url=http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm | accessdate=2008-03-31 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Gates took a [[leave of absence]] from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their [[partnership]] &quot;Micro-soft&quot; and had their first office located in Albuquerque.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name &quot;Microsoft&quot; was registered with the [[USPTO]].&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt;

[[Microsoft]]'s BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]] in the MITS newsletter saying that MITS could not continue to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software without payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp1&quot; /&gt; The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in [[Bellevue, Washington]] on January 1, 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyevents&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Key Events In Microsoft History | url=http://www.microsoft.com/visitorcenter/student.mspx | accessdate=2008-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, he personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.&lt;ref name=&quot;waterloo&quot;&gt;{{cite speech|url=http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/2005/10-13Waterloo.aspx|last=Gates|first=Bill|title=Remarks by Bill Gates|date=2005-10-13|location=Waterloo, Ontario|accessdate = 2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IBM partnership===
In 1980 [[IBM]] approached Microsoft to make the BASIC interpreter for its upcoming personal computer, the [[IBM PC]]. When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an [[operating system]], Gates referred them to [[Digital Research]] (DRI), makers of the widely used [[CP/M]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html|title=Pioneers Die Broke|publisher=[[Forbes]]|author=Maiello, John Steele Gordon Michael |date=2002-12-23|accessdate =2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later Gates proposed using [[86-DOS]] (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that [[Tim Paterson]] of [[Seattle Computer Products]] had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as [[IBM PC-DOS|PC-DOS]] in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000. Gates insisted that IBM let Microsoft keep the [[copyright]] on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gates|1996|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did, and the sales of [[MS-DOS]] made Microsoft a major player in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windows===
Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in [[Washington]] and made Gates President of Microsoft and the Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyevents&quot; /&gt; Microsoft launched its first retail version of [[Microsoft Windows]] on November 20, 1985, and in August, the company struck a deal with [[IBM]] to develop a separate operating system called [[OS/2]]. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, mounting creative differences undermined the partnership. Gates distributed an internal memo on May 16, 1991 announcing that the OS/2 partnership was over and Microsoft would shift its efforts to the [[Windows NT]] [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bralyn.net/etext/literature/bill.gates/challenges-strategy.txt | title=May 16, 1991 internal strategies memo from Bill Gates | publisher=Bralyn|accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management style===
[[Image:Billgates.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Bill Gates giving his deposition at Microsoft on August 27, 1998]]
From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He aggressively broadened the company's range of products, and wherever Microsoft achieved a dominant position he vigorously defended it.

As an executive, Gates met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. Firsthand accounts of these meetings describe him as verbally combative, berating managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;rensin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=David|last=Rensin|title=The Bill Gates Interview|date=1994|journal=Playboy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/churchillclub.mspx | title=Steve Ballmer Speech Transcript&amp;nbsp;— Church Hill Club | first=Steve|last=Ballmer | date=1997-10-09 | publisher=[[Microsoft]] | accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He often interrupted presentations with such comments as, &quot;That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;time GOS&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.time.com/time/gates/gates5.html | first=Walter | last=Isaacson | title=The Gates Operating System | publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=1997-01-13 | accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, &quot;Why don't you just give up your [[Option (finance)|options]] and join the [[Peace Corps]]?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.breakingwindows.net/1link3.htm | title=Breaking Windows | publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | author= Bank, David|date=1999-02-01 | accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.&lt;ref name=&quot;time GOS&quot; /&gt; When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, &quot;I'll do it over the weekend.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;chapman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pdc97&quot;&gt;{{cite speech | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/1997/pdc.aspx | first=Bill | last=Gates | title=Remarks by Bill Gates | location=[[San Diego, California]] | date=1997-09-26 | accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;herbold&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|year=2004|last=Herbold|title=The Fiefdom Syndrome: The Turf Battles That Undermine Careers and Companies - And How to Overcome Them}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates's role at Microsoft for most of its history was primarily a management and executive role. However, he was an active software developer in the early years, particularly on the company's [[programming language]] products. He has not officially been on a development team since working on the [[TRS-80 Model 100 line]], but  wrote code as late as 1989 that shipped in the company's products.&lt;ref name=&quot;pdc97&quot;/&gt; On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors, placing [[Ray Ozzie]] in charge of day-to-day management and [[Craig Mundie]] in charge of long-term product strategy.&lt;ref name=&quot;mscorpnews&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jun06/06-15CorpNewsPR.mspx | title=Microsoft Announces Plans for July 2008 Transition for Bill Gates | publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antitrust law violations===
{{see|United States Microsoft antitrust case|European Union Microsoft competition case}}
Many decisions that led to [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] litigation over Microsoft's [[business practices]] have had Gates's approval. In the 1998 ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'' case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner [[David Boies]] over the contextual meaning of words like &quot;compete,&quot; &quot;concerned,&quot; and &quot;we.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-30|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/index.html|title=Gates deposition makes judge laugh in court|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=1998-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''BusinessWeek'' reported:

{{quotation|Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail Gates both sent and received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-30|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1998/48/b3606125.htm|title=Microsoft's Teflon Bill|publisher=[[BusinessWeek]]|date=1998-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gates later said that he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, &quot;Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;truth&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heilemann|first=John|title=The Truth, The Whole Truth, and Nothing But The Truth|date=2000-11-01|journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.11/microsoft_pr.html|accessdate = 2008-03-31|month=May|author=Chen, Hy; Wu, Js; Hyland, B; Lu, Xd; Chen, Jj|volume=|issue=|pages=|pmid=18509686|doi=10.1007/s11517-008-0355-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Gates's denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization and tying, blocking competition, in violation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;truth&quot; /&gt;

The '''European Union Microsoft competition case''' is also a case brought by the [[European Commission]] of the [[European Union]] (EU) against [[Microsoft]] for abuse of its dominant position in the market (according to [[competition law]]). It started as a complaint from [[Novell]] over Microsoft's licensing practices in 1993, and eventually resulted in the EU ordering Microsoft to divulge certain information about its server products and release a version of [[Microsoft Windows]] without [[Windows Media Player]].

===Appearance in ads===
Bill Gates decided in 2008 to appear in at least 1 commercial in a series of ads to promote [[Microsoft]]. This commercial, co-starring [[Jerry Seinfeld]], is a 1 and a half minute talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Bill Gates buying shoes inside. The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. Mr. Seinfeld begins to inform him about a pair of shoes called Conquistadors that run &quot;a little tight&quot; and sells him on them in a size 10 (whereas the store clerk was attempting an 11). As Mr. Gates is buying the shoes he holds up his discount card, this card uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977 for a traffic violation &lt;ref&gt; http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/gatesmug1.html &lt;/ref&gt;. As they are walking out of the mall, Jerry Seinfeld asks Bill Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a yes, he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a yes. Most critics are still in debate over the exact meaning of this commercial saying that it is too vague to make sense to them. Though some say that it is an homage to Mr. Seinfeld's own show about &quot;nothing&quot;([[Seinfeld]]). &lt;ref&gt; http://adblog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/09/08/1362333.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Gates married [[Melinda Gates]] (née French) from [[Dallas, TX|Dallas]], [[Texas]] on January 1, 1994. They have three children: Jennifer Katharine(1996), Rory John(1999) and Phoebe Adele(2002).
[[Bill Gates' house]] is a 21st century [[earth sheltering|earth-sheltered home]] in the side of a hill overlooking [[Lake Washington]] in [[Medina, Washington|Medina]], [[Washington]]. According to [[King County, Washington|King County]] public records, as of 2006, the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125 million, and the annual property tax is $991,000. Also among Gates's private acquisitions is the [[Codex Leicester]], a collection of writings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], which Gates bought for $30.8 million at an auction in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lesinski|2006|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates is also known as an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from [[The Great Gatsby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Gates was number one on the &quot;[[Forbes 400]]&quot; list from 1993 through to 2007 and number one on ''Forbes'' list of &quot;[[Lists of billionaires|The World's Richest People]]&quot; from 1995 to 2007. In 1999, Gates's wealth briefly surpassed $101 billion, causing the media to call him a &quot;centibillionaire&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fridson|2001|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the [[dot-com bubble]] burst and the multi-billion dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolger|first=Joe|date=2006-05-05|title=I wish I was not the richest man in the world, says Bill Gates|publisher=[[The Times]]|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/markets/united_states/article713434.ece|accessdate = 2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of $616,667, and $350,000 bonus totalling $966,667.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Microsoft 2006 Proxy Statement | url=http://www.microsoft.com/msft/reports/proxy2006.mspx | publisher=[[Microsoft]] | date=2007-10-06 | accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded [[Corbis]], a digital imaging company, in 1989.

===Philanthropy===
{{see| Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation}}
Gates began to realize the expectations others had of him when public opinion mounted that he could give more of his wealth to charity. Gates studied the work of [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]] and in 1994 sold some of his Microsoft stock to create the William H. Gates Foundation. In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations into one to create the charitable [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], which is the largest [[Transparency (humanities)|transparently]] operated [[charitable foundation]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-01|url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6919139|title=Flat-pack accounting |publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=2006-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation is setup to allow benefactors access how its money is being spent, unlike other major [[charitable organization]]s such as the [[Wellcome Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-01|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3913581.stm|title=Bill Gates: billionaire philanthropist |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2005-01-25|author=Cronin, Jon }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-01|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/OurWork/OurApproach/|title=Our Approach to Giving |publisher=[[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The generosity and extensive philanthropy of [[David Rockefeller]] has been credited as a major influence. Gates and his father have met with Rockefeller several times and have modeled their giving in part on the [[Rockefeller family]]'s philanthropic focus, namely those global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;bill foundation&quot;&gt;{{cite paper | title=2005 Annual Report | format=.PDF | publisher=[[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] | url=http://www.rbf.org/usr_doc/2005_Annual_Review.pdf | date=2006-01-01 | accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007 Bill and Melinda Gates were the second most generous philanthropist in America, having given over $28 billion to charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bwnt.businessweek.com/interactive%5Freports/philanthropy%5Findividual/ The 50 most generous Americans] &lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation has also received criticism because it invests the assets that it has not yet distributed, with the exclusive goal of maximizing the [[return on investment]]. As a result, its investments include companies that have been criticized for worsening poverty in the same developing countries where the Foundation is attempting to relieve poverty. These include companies that pollute heavily and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gatesx07jan07,0,6827615.story Dark cloud over good works of Gates Foundation], Los Angeles Times, 7 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
In response to press criticism, the foundation announced in 2007 a review of its investments to assess social responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003517601_gatesinvest10.html Gates Foundation to review investments], The Seattle Times, 10 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently cancelled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/nation/01/14/14gates.html Gates Foundation to maintain its investment plan], The Austin Statesman, 14 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries|LSA]], [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]]''' ([[June 9]] [[1836]] &amp;ndash; [[December 17]] [[1917]]), was an [[England|English]] [[physician]] and [[feminism|feminist]], the first woman to gain a medical qualification in Britain.

==Biography==
Garrett was the daughter of [[Newson Garrett]], of [[Aldeburgh]], [[Suffolk]], where she was born in 1836, and the sister of [[Millicent Fawcett]]. She was also the cousin of Elizabeth Dunnell who married Richard Garrett III the famous owner of [[Richard Garrett &amp; Sons]]. Elizabeth was educated at home and at a private school. In 1860 she resolved to study medicine, an almost unheard-of thing for a woman at that time, and regarded by some as almost indecent. Having obtained some more or less irregular instruction at the [[Middlesex Hospital]], [[London]], she was refused admission as a full student both there and at many other medical schools to which she applied.  Finally she studied anatomy privately at the London Hospital, and with some of the professors at the [[University of St Andrews]], and at the [[Edinburgh]] Extra-Mural school.  She had no less difficulty in gaining a qualifying diploma to practise medicine.  London University, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, and many other examining bodies refused to admit her to their examinations; but in the end the [[Society of Apothecaries]] allowed her to enter for the Licence of Apothecaries' Hall, which she obtained in 1865. This entitled her to have her name entered on the [[General Medical Council|medical register]], the second woman after [[Elizabeth Blackwell]], and the first woman qualified in Britain to do so.

In 1866 she was appointed general medical attendant to St Mary's Dispensary, a London institution started to enable poor women to obtain medical help from qualified practitioners of their own sex.  The dispensary soon developed into the [[New Hospital for Women]], and there Dr Garrett worked for over twenty years.  In 1870 she obtained the University of Paris degree of [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], three months after [[Frances Hoggan]] obtained that qualification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/sites/brecon_life/pages/franceshoggan.shtml BBC - Mid Wales Brecon Life - Pioneering Physician&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The same year she was elected to the first [[London School Board]], at the head of the poll for [[Marylebone]], and was also made one of the visiting physicians of the East London Hospital for Children; but the duties of these two positions she found to be incompatible with her principal work, and she soon resigned them. She also built a medical school for woman.

In 1871 she married James George Skelton Anderson (d. 1907) of the [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|Orient Steamship Company]] co-owned by his uncle [[Arthur Anderson (businessman)|Arthur Anderson]], but she did not give up her practice.  She had three children, Louisa, Margaret who died of meningitis, and Alan. [[Louisa Garrett Anderson|Louisa]] also became a pioneering doctor of medicine and social campaigner. 

In 1873 she gained membership of the [[British Medical Association]] and remained the only woman member for 19 years, due to the Association's vote against the admission of further women — &quot;one of several instances where Garrett, uniquely, was able to enter a hitherto all male medical institution which subsequently moved formally to exclude any women who might seek to follow her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Elston, &quot;Anderson, Elizabeth Garrett (1836–1917)&quot;, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Oct 2005 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30406, accessed 4 Feb 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth worked steadily at the development of the New Hospital for Women, and (from 1874) at the creation of the [[London School of Medicine for Women]].  Both institutions have since been handsomely and suitably housed and equipped, the New hospital for Women (in the Euston Road) for many years being worked entirely by medical women, and the schools (in Hunter Street, WC1) having over 200 students, most of them preparing for the medical degree of London University (the present-day [[University College London]]), which was opened to women in 1877. In 1897 Dr Garrett Anderson was elected president of the East Anglian branch of the [[British Medical Association]].  

On [[9 November]] [[1908]] she was elected mayor of [[Aldeburgh]], the first female mayor in England.  

The movement for the admission of women to the medical profession, of which Dr Anderson was the indefatigable pioneer in [[England]], extended in her lifetime to all of North America and Europe, except for Spain and Turkey. She died in 1917 and is buried in [[Aldeburgh]].

Notes:
* The New Hospital for Women was renamed the [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital]] in 1918 and amalgamated with the [[Obstetric Hospital]] in 2001 to form the [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Obstetric Hospital]]&lt;ref name=&quot;UCLH&quot;&gt;[http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/Our+hospitals/Elizabeth+Garrett+Anderson+and+Obstetric+Hospital.htm UCLH - Our hospitals - Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Obstetric Hospital]&lt;/ref&gt;.
* She took part in the [[Suffrage]] movement.
* There is a ward at the [[Royal Free Hospital]] called the Garrett Anderson ward, specialising in infectious and respiratory diseases.
* In 1861 Elizabeth visited her family accompanied by her friend [[Emily Davies]].  Sitting by the fireside with her sister [[Millicent Fawcett|Millicent]] they selected careers for advancing the frontiers of women's rights, Elizabeth took Medicine, Emily took education, and 13 year old Milly was allocated politics and votes for women.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Abdella, BBC Radio 4 / Great Lives&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is a campaign underway to redevelop part of the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital, details of which are available at http://www.egaforwomen.org.uk
